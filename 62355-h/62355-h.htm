your Lordships will not refuse

happiness of being several years
a purser in the Navy, tho afterwards
unfortunately ingaged under
the command of captain <span class="antiqua">Shelvocke</span>
in this cruising expedition.
As his pretended narrative
is intirely a deception, and his
whole conduct an indignity to his
country, I thought it my duty to
give your Lordships a genuine
account of the man as well as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
our voyage; which I have done
truly and impartially, not without
hopes it may prove entertaining.
If, my Lords, I am never
to meet with any recompense for
my hardships, I have yet the satisfaction
of asserting the honor
of his Majesty’s commission, defending
the cause of some of his
injured subjects; and being devoted
to his perpetual interest,

<span class="x-large"><i>SOUTH SEA</i>.</span></h2>

<p>Voyages have been always well
receiv’d, and especially by <i>Englishmen</i>.
They seem to sute the genius
of the <i>British</i> nation, whose people are particularly
distinguish’d for the curiosity of
their temper, and the many great exploits
of their shipping in all parts of the world.
’Tis true, this sort of history is often writ by
unskilful hands; and a fact sometimes loses
credit for want of method in telling it: but
if the reader meets with something new and
authentic, he is generally satisfied: the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
greatest pleasure of the mind being an addition
to our knowledge.</p>

<p>The following book is a united journal of
two ships, written chiefly to undeceive mankind
in the spurious account of a voyage
round the world, publish’d by captain <i>George
Shelvocke</i>: which account is not only injurious
to me, but is intirely the most absurd
and false narrative that was ever deliver’d
to the publick. And surely a man may be
excus’d for setting the world right in any public
affair; much more in an enterprise, where
the credit and dignity of his country are
concern’d. And if our resentments are allow’d
to be equal to injuries receiv’d, what
must mine be, when stript of property and
good name? Both which the said <i>Shelvocke</i>
has done his utmost to accomplish: And
though some of this treatise is to obviate
his many abuses and forgeries, yet I have
endeavoured to make even that part entertaining;
to avoid giving the reader a mere
dry story of his wickedness.</p>

<p>Beside our sea journal, I have collected
the observations I made while in the kingdoms
of <i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i>, concerning the <i>Spanish</i>
dominions in <i>America</i>. The trade,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
customs, luxury, and gallantry of the <i>Creolians</i>.
To which I have added an account
of their gold and silver mines, their manner
of separating the mineral from the ore, and
many other things; all which together, I
need not doubt, will prove an agreeable
history of this voyage.</p>

<p>In the proceding of our two ships I have
the pleasure to be well assisted; having procured
the original journal of Mr. <i>George
Taylor</i>, chief mate to captain <i>Clipperton</i>, who
commanded this expedition, which I shall
make use of to invalidate captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
false accounts: which journal will at once
let the reader into the most material transactions
of <i>Clipperton</i>, and convince mankind
of his faithful intentions, tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i>
has taken such mighty pains to vilify
him.</p>

<p>Besides which, I have the concurring evidence
of many who were aboard the <i>Speedwell</i>;
some of which are now in <i>London</i>
ready to speak the truth: and tho I am
thorowly satisfyd our story will speak it
self, yet some of the chief facts are already
sworn to; the affidavits being filed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Chancery, and to be seen at the office in
<i>Chancery-lane</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1718, during the war between
their <i>Imperial</i> and <i>Catholic</i> Majesties, and
while a rupture was daily expected between
<i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Spain</i>; some persons of
distinction, and merchants of the city of
<i>London</i> agreed upon a subscription, to fit
out two private ships of war, under the Emperor’s
commission, to cruise upon the <i>Spaniards</i>
in the <i>South Seas</i>. The chief motives
for such an expedition were the desire of
being better acquainted with the navigation
of that part of the world, to put their seafaring
friends into a promising imployment,
and the many views they had of a prosperous
return from so well concerted an undertaking.
But tho the said breach between
<i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Spain</i> was known to be
unavoidable, yet, upon the delay of actual
hostilities, the aforesaid gentlemen were desirous
to take the advantage of the war between
the <i>Emperor</i> and the king of <i>Spain</i>:
and in order to have their ships in the <i>South
Sea</i> before the season was far advanced, they
obtained his <i>Imperial</i> Majesty’s commission,
and mand their ships with a good number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of his subjects. They named their first ship
the <i>Prince Eugene</i>, and the other the <i>Starenberg</i>.
Of this armament <i>George Shelvocke</i>
was appointed to be commander in chief,
who had sometime serv’d as a lieutenant in
the <i>British</i> navy. Whereupon he was forthwith
order’d to <i>Ostend</i>, there to receive the
<i>Flemish</i> officers, the seamen and commission
aboard the <i>Starenberg</i>: and among other
things, receiv’d orders not to fire any guns,
or hoist any colours, while in that port;
and to take aboard no more than sixty
<i>Flemings</i>, with three officers; and when he
had got his men, wine, and brandy, to proceed
directly to the <i>Downs</i>.</p>

<p>In the mean time the <i>Prince Eugene</i> arrived
in the <i>Downs</i>, having been fitted and
man’d in the river. Three of the owners
went to <i>Deal</i>, expecting to meet with both
the ships; but were uneasy to find captain
<i>Shelvocke</i> was not yet come. However upon
his arrival, they inquir’d into the cause
of his delay, and were surprised to find he
had idly neglected joining his consort as
early as he ought; had broke thro’ his orders,
made entertainments, hoisted Imperial
colours, brought over ninety <i>Flemings</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
six officers, fir’d away five barrels of powder,
began upon his wine and brandy which the
owners had put aboard him, and was design’d
as the whole stock for both ships, to comfort
them in their long and hazardous voyage.
And in short so ill did he behave, as to bring
his owners to change the command, and in
his room appoint <i>John Clipperton</i> captain of
the larger ship, and commander in chief,
who had made two voyages to the <i>South
Sea</i> before. Besides, the <i>Flemings</i> were so
many in number, and so ill chosen, that
the <i>British</i> seamen grew uneasy. The former
having their own officers, seem’d to
over-value themselves upon their sovereign’s
commission, which was not relished by the
<i>Englishmen</i>. It occasion’d a mix’d command,
and produc’d frequent animosities;
so that it was judged impracticable for them
to go the voyage together. At length the
war being begun between <i>Great Britain</i> and
<i>Spain</i> in the <i>Mediterranean</i>, the owners
agreed to get his Majesty King <i>George</i>’s commission,
and to send over the foreign commission,
men and officers to <i>Flanders</i>, paying
their charges, and allowing two months
wages to the men. After which the owners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
order’d their ships, being now called the
<i>Success</i> and <i>Speedwel</i>, to <i>Plymouth</i>, to be
there recruited in their provision, and get
their complement of men.</p>

<p><i>Clipperton</i> being thus appointed commander
in chief, had also the biggest ship, the
<i>Success</i>, of thirty six guns and 180 men. <i>Shelvocke</i>
had the <i>Speedwel</i>, twenty four guns,
and one hundred and six men, under whose
command I was appointed captain of marines.
The ships lay near three months at
<i>Plymouth</i> for a wind; in which time <i>Shelvocke</i>
continually shewed his resentment at
the change of command, in such a manner
that there was a faction fermented from the
captains to the cabin boys.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> And tho’ he
did endeavour to curb his restless spirit, yet
was it so publickly apparent, that one of
the owners, who was chief director of this
affair, wrote to him to mind him of his
conduct, and warn him of his duty: to which
very man this <i>Shelvocke</i> owes his having the
<i>Speedwel</i>, being the second command in this
undertaking. The same gentleman has also
assur’d me, that, when <i>Shelvocke</i> apply’d by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
letter to him for employment, his circumstances
were so low, that he did not scruple
to declare he had no bread to eat; nor a
friend in the world except him, to expect any
favour from. Whereupon the said gentleman
having served with him in the navy
aboard the same ship, generously invited
<i>Shelvocke</i> to his country house, where he
made him a present of a twenty pound note
on his goldsmith, till he could effectually
provide for him, having then this enterprise
in view. When he first told him he
should command one of these ships, <i>Shelvocke</i>
was so throughly pleas’d with the
news, that he vow’d it was greatly beyond
his expectation; and rather than not go the
voyage at all, he would content himself to
be boatswain’s mate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
See pag. 28. of his preface, where he says he stifled his
resentment, not suffering it to break out into an open flame.</p></div>

<p>The purport of the aforesaid letter sent
to <i>Plymouth</i>, was to advise <i>Shelvocke</i> of his
mutinous behaviour and rudeness to captain
<i>Clipperton</i>; and that by return of the mail,
if the owners did not receive assurances of
his intire contentment with the post he had,
a commission would be sent down for another
person to command the <i>Speedwel</i> in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
his room. Upon which captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
wrote at several times as followeth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“I Am favour’d with yours; but surpris’d
very much at so sudden a change:
but the many favours I have received from
your hands, has easily brought me to a resolution
of submitting.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Dec. 13. 1718.</i>
I am easy, perfectly easy, and very heartily
thankful for all your favours. I am
far from thinking it a disrepute to serve
you in any capacity. For God’s sake, Sir,
pardon small falts: I starve without your
friendship. I know the world so well, that
I have no other friend&mdash;&mdash;<i>Dec. 19.</i> I assure
you I shall always act like a faithful
servant: and no spirit shall proceed from
me, but such as honour and gratitude directs.
I shall with the greatest cheerfulness
shew captain <i>Clipperton</i> all the respect
in the world.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jan. 27. 1719.</i> All
resentments are laid aside by me long since,
and don’t doubt of brotherhood with captain
<i>Clipperton</i>. Our ships are much better
man’d than ever, both bearing more
than their complement; and I am very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
glad of the addition you have been pleased
to make of so many gentlemen to the
service.”</p>

<p>All these particulars I had from the said
gentleman since my return from the voyage;
and captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s letters are here inserted
to shew how forward he was to promise,
and how little he meant to perform.</p>

<p>By the sequel of his behaviour throughout
this book, all mankind will see what
conceal’d revenge he had in his heart: Being
determin’d henceforth pyratically to
act, arbitrarily to manage and destroy so
well concerted a scheme for the interest of
all parties, and to disappoint the hopes of
many other people, who were desirous to
shew the <i>Spanish</i> nation how small a force
from <i>England</i> could annoy and plunder them
in their most powerful, distant settlements.</p>

<p>Here it must be observ’d with what care
<i>Shelvocke</i> has avoided giving the true reasons
why the command was changed; and has
labour’d to throw the miscarriage of the
expedition on <i>Clipperton</i>’s incapacity, the
change of officers, and the frequent mutinies
of his own men: whereas I shall fully
prove that the ruin of our voyage was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the consequence of his own pride, avarice
and treachery.</p>

<p>’Tis to be noted that captain <i>Clipperton</i> died
before <i>Shelvocke</i> had any thoughts of writing
a book: And it’s highly probable that if <i>Clipperton</i>
were alive to answer for himself, <i>Shelvocke</i>
had never been bold enough to print
such a scandalous history. And as to <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
officers, they were so far from being
accessary to any miscarriage, that he never
consulted us on any occasion whatever;
tho’ he, as well as <i>Clipperton</i>, had strict
orders in all enterprizes to follow that excellent
scheme framed and practised by
captain <i>Woodes Rogers</i> in his memorable
voyage round the globe; which is certainly
the safest method for all navigators, who
mean to execute any project of this kind;
and for which end <i>Rogers</i>’s printed journal
was put aboard each ship. It was his
rule never to undertake any thing of moment,
without first calling a council of his
chief officers, who in writing testify’d their
approbation of, and concurrence in the
execution of the design: But our captain
was above confining himself to any precedents
or orders, his will being the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
reason for all he did, so that he never
kept any journal or diary at all; which is
perfectly agreeable to his resolution, and
the design he first had in view, never to
join the <i>Success</i> after he lost company with
her in the storm mention’d in the third
page of his book: And tho’ he seems sorry
at the separation, yet the <i>Success</i> had most
reason to be so, for <i>Shelvocke</i> had the whole
store of wine and brandy aboard the <i>Speedwell</i>;
so that <i>Clipperton</i> was forc’d to go a
tedious comfortless voyage without any.
<i>Shelvocke</i>, indeed, says he offer’d him his
liquors when at sea, and the other neglected
to take them in; which, if true, is not
a material objection, because <i>Clipperton</i> expecting
no treachery, but a punctual meeting
to the windward of grand <i>Canary</i>, the
first place of rendezvous, doubtless thought
it might be then time enough; but I question
the fact, because <i>Taylor</i>’s journal takes
no notice of their speaking with each other
that day, which runs thus.</p>

<p>“<i>Success Feb. 15.</i> these 24 hours fresh
gales and squally with rain. This evening
unbent our best and small bowers, stow’d
our anchors, and have been oblig’d to shorten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
sail several times for the <i>Speedwell</i>.”</p>

<p>But, however, to shew that <i>Shelvocke</i> was
well enough pleas’d to part with his consort,
he steer’d a course quite different from
the <i>Success</i>, and contrary to his duty; as
appears by <i>Taylor</i>’s journal. “<i>Feb. 20.</i>
These 24 hours fresh gales and cloudy
with small rain. At two this afternoon,
the storm being somewhat abated, we
wore and made sail, steering away south
and by east.” And continuing his course
to the Southward, arrived off the <i>Canaries</i>
the sixth of <i>March</i> following, which run
he made in fourteen days: Whereas <i>Shelvocke</i>
p. 4. has it thus. “<i>Feb. 20.</i> We
had no sight of the <i>Success</i> or any other
vessel. At noon we set the mainsail
double reefed, and at midnight the topsails,
and stood to the north-west,” when
it’s plain, he might have steer’d the same
course to the southward, but for views of
his own went to the northward; and accordingly
did not arrive at the <i>Canaries</i>,
till he might well judge his consort was
gone: For page 9. he owns his arrival there
on the seventeenth of <i>March</i>, which is
eleven days difference, and with this aggravation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
that instead of going to the windward,
I well remember we hawl’d close in
under the lee of the said island, being the
north-east side thereof; because the winds
govern there most part of the year in the
south-west board.</p>

<p>The next day after losing company, <i>Shelvocke</i>
seeing a piece of a wreck float along
the <i>Speedwell</i>’s side, endeavour’d to persuade
us, that <i>Clipperton</i> was lost in the
storm, alledging, for his reasons, that the
<i>Success</i> was built very slight, greater regard
being had to her sailing than burdening
well, and that her weight of metal had torn
her sides out, and so was gone to the bottom.
But finding this did not pass with
us, he then insisted that she bore away for
<i>France</i> or <i>Ireland</i>, to purchase wine or brandy,
without which, according to him, nothing
at all was to be done: And I own it
was very hard to be forc’d on a long voyage
to the southward, when the sun was in his
northern course, without either of those
chearful supports of nature. But to prove
that <i>Clipperton</i> could do his duty without
wine and brandy, he like a good officer
sail’d to the <i>Canaries</i>, being the first place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of rendezvous; and cruising there his limited
time, proceded to St. <i>Vincent</i>, one
of the <i>Cape de Verd</i> islands; at one of
which places he doubted not of meeting us.</p>

<p><i>Taylor</i>’s journal has it thus,</p>

<p>“<i>Success, March 15, 1719.</i> Having cruised
ten days off the <i>Canaries</i>, without
meeting our consort or taking any prize,
and in little hopes of either, we steer
away to the <i>Cape de Verd</i> islands: And
at six this forenoon the island <i>Gomera</i>
bore north half west, distant nine leagues,
latitude 28 : 00 north, longitude 00 : 00
west, whence I take my departure.”</p>

<p>But <i>Shelvocke</i>, who never design’d to give
the owners any true account of his captures
or procedings, from this time stood resolved
to act independently on <i>Clipperton</i>, and never
meet him again, except by chance: for
as soon as we had lost the <i>Success</i>, <i>Hendrie</i>
and <i>Dod</i>, as well as my self, who were at
his table, often heard him declare, he never
would join her again, or words to that
effect: wherein he fulfill’d his promise by
knocking his ship on the head at <i>Fernandes</i>,
the circumstances of which, as I shall hereafter
relate them, will make it plainly appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
to be done on purpose. And further,
he assur’d us all at several times, that on his
return to <i>Europe</i>, he would avoid <i>England</i>,
and go to <i>Hamburgh</i>, or some other free
port, and there remain till he should bring
his owners to a composition; adding with
an oath, that if they went to law, he would
hold them to it with their own money. And
herein also he has kept his word; for though
he has been in <i>London</i> these five years, he
still refuses giving the owners any satisfaction:
taking care however by absconding, to
avoid being served with a writ in <i>Chancery</i>;
which I believe would soon put an end to
the suit so long carrying on by the gentlemen
adventurers, on the evidence of many
who serv’d on board the <i>Speedwell</i>, as well as
my own.</p>

<p>And such was this man’s particular affection
for strong liquors, that we have often
heard him say, there was but one honest
fellow among all the gentlemen adventurers;
for he spoke well when he desired we
might have brandy and wine enough; tho’
all the time we were fitting out, he was
pleas’d to call them men of worth and honour,
and never failed at every fresh bottle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
to drink their healths: But now ’tis damn
them; and for his part he would take care
of number one. This new way of treating
our Patrons, whose property we were then
making very free with, somewhat startled us:
and I fearing these frequent declarations of
his would rather tend to disunite the ship’s
company, and ruin our scheme, look’d often
towards <i>Hatley</i> our second captain, as expecting
he would speak first; but finding him
silent, I address’d my self to our commander
in these words: Sir, if I may have leave
to offer my thoughts upon these frank declarations
of your designs, it is my humble
opinion, that to act separately from captain
<i>Clipperton</i>, will terminate in the ruin of
this expedition. To which he answered,
no, no, we have a good ship, well man’d,
and found with all necessaries; we shall do
well enough: I reply’d, that surely our
owners would have hardly put themselves
to the expense of two ships, could they
have had any reasonable prospect of making
a good voyage with one in these remote
parts. This threw <i>Shelvocke</i> into a great
rage: He us’d me ill; said I was insolent,
and ask’d me if I meant to usurp the command
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the ship? The next day at dinner
I drank, as usual, the gentlemens health to
whom we were all indebted for this favourable
prospect of making our fortunes. At
this he flung his cann at my Head, while I
was drinking, and took it for an insult of
his authority. Nor did he spare any of his
other officers; but at one time or other
struck us all, except Mr. <i>Dod</i>, whose greater
advance in years perhaps protected him.</p>

<p>This scandalous treatment I was forc’d to
undergo for the honour I did the gentlemen
owners, and respectfully mentioning the necessity
of our rejoining the <i>Success</i>. And
from this time a universal discontent appear’d
in the ship’s company, not only among the
officers, but was visible in the faces of the
meanest of the crew. For <i>Shelvocke</i>, to improve
his own design, went so far as to insinuate,
that at our return the gentlemen
would be cunning enough to defraud us of
our proper dividends; tho’ I dare say there
was none among us, who did not think it
more dishonourable to mistrust a set of worthy
gentlemen, than to find our selves deceiv’d
by them at last.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>Thus may the impartial reader see that all
the uneasiness of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s men was occasioned
by his own inhumanity and perfidiousness:
And tho’ none of his officers, except
my self, ever offer’d to controvert his
base conduct, or absurd sentiments, yet he
has the assurance <i>p</i>. 4. to say his people mutinied,
and pretended the ship was incapable
to go through the voyage.</p>

<p>I will allow the men that the ship was
very full and much pester’d, but can’t allow
<i>Shelvocke</i> that she was so crank or tender as
not to carry sail. The wind was then at
S. W. or S. W. by W. and he owns he carried
his topsails the next day after the
storm, which was the 20<sup>th</sup> of <i>Feb.</i> Could
she not then make as good way to the
southward with her starboard tacks aboard,
as she could to the northward with her larboard?</p>

<p>Page 7. <i>Shelvocke</i> gravely tells his readers
that <i>Hatley</i>, second captain, disputed
the command with him. The Story in
short is thus: Some questions arising about
seamanship, and both of them fuddled,
<i>Hatley</i> seem’d too tenacious of his opinion;
at which <i>Shelvocke</i> in a fury bolted up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
“See, gentlemen, do you mind how the
villain disputes the command with me?”
These were his very words, using him but
in a scurvy manner before all the company,
and upon the quarter-deck: after which he
order’d the men to call him no otherwise
than Mr. <i>Hatley</i>. This we’ll suppose they
submitted to, and indulg’d the mighty <i>Shelvocke</i>
in his mean vanity.</p>

<p>His son <i>George</i> too contributed much to
the company’s uneasiness, tho’ he had no
real business to go with us; for his name is
not among those who subscrib’d the articles:
and he knew nothing of sea affairs,
or indeed of any thing else that was commendable
or manly. His imployment at
<i>London</i> was to dangle after the women,
and gossip at the tea-table; and aboard us,
his whole business was to thrust himself into
all society, overhear every thing that
was said, then go and tell his father: so
that he was more fit for aboarding school
than a ship of war. Yet had this insignificant
fellow a dividend of 660 pound out
of one prize, in prejudice to many honest
brave men, destroy’d, lost and begger’d at
the captain’s pleasure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>We are now to the leeward of <i>Grand
Canary</i>, where our captain takes a little
fisherman’s bark, I’m positive not above
eight or ten ton, and which we all pray’d
might be turn’d adrift for the poor owner’s
use, but in vain; for tho’ of no import at
all to us, yet to him she serv’d as a good pretext
for santering away ten or twelve days,
fitting her out in a warlike manner to peep
into every creek of the lee of that and
the neighbouring islands, till <i>Clipperton</i> may
be well supposed gone far enough ahead.</p>

<p>The next place of rendezvous he conceals
from his officers. By his own account,
which follows, one would suspect
him to be guilty; but by the help of
<i>Taylor</i>’s journal I shall convict him
throughly.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> p. 9. “Having finish’d my
cruise without meeting or hearing of the
<i>Success</i>, I found my self in a very melancholy
state, when I came to consider
that the next appointed rendezvous was
at the island <i>John Fernandes</i> in the great
<i>South Seas</i>.” And yet p. 11. he says, “We
took our departure from <i>Faro</i>, one of
the <i>Canaries</i>, in hopes of meeting captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
<i>Clipperton</i> among the <i>Cape de Verd</i>
islands, and took our prize along with
us.”&mdash;&mdash;which I am sure was not worth
a commission ship to be troubled with 300
leagues.</p>

<p>He well knew this was the next place
agreed to meet at, tho’ carefully concealed
from us; however <i>Taylor</i>’s journal confirms
it.</p>

<p>“<i>Success, March 21.</i> Fresh gales, <i>&amp;c.</i>
At six this afternoon we saw St. <i>Vincent</i>,
at ten next morning we anchor’d in the
bay and found a <i>French</i> merchant ship
and the <i>Diamond</i> of <i>Bristol</i>, captain <i>Cleader</i>,
taking in an odd sort of cargo for
<i>Jamaica</i>, <i>viz.</i> asses. This being appointed
the next place of rendezvous, we were
in hopes to find the <i>Speedwell</i>, but are
convinced of the contrary, to our great
surprise, and greater concern for the want
of our liquors, without the moderate
use of which, it’s dull living either ashore
or at sea; so that I cannot help saying we
all look like the cargo aforemention’d,
for suffering <i>Shelvocke</i> to keep our wine
and brandy.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>Now let any indifferent person judge
whether ’tis probable that <i>Fernandes</i> could
be the next appointed rendezvous from the
<i>Canaries</i>, being a run of no less than 120
degrees.</p>

<p>We arrive next at the isle of <i>May</i>, and
are taken for pyrates; <i>Shelvocke</i> gives it
the softer name of freebooters. Here I remember
we had six silver goblets for our
common drinking, and he, like a careful officer,
lest they should be lost, calls up the
armourer to melt and hammer five of them
into circles to adorn the outside of a fine
pail, made by the cooper, for the more glorious
drinking of <i>Hipsy</i>, a liquor compounded
of wine, water and brandy, which
by the admirers of it, is also call’d mear, drink
and cloth. And now I took leave of a
glass of pure wine; for <i>Shelvocke</i> labouring
a little with the gout, imagined this
compound to be its best antidote, and so
we all lived upon it in a wanton manner,
till our wine and brandy was exhausted;
which, tho’ designed for the use of both
ships, hardly served us a twelve month.</p>

<p>This also proved a means of dividing us;
for those, whom hard drinking did not agree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
with, he distinguish’d with a sour morose
behaviour, and look’d on them as malecontents;
so that the quantity of <i>Hipsy</i> was
the only title to a proportion of merit in
our captain’s favour.</p>

<p><i>Taylor</i>’s journal gives the following account
of the island of St. <i>Vincent</i>, which
I thought not improper to insert. “That
it affords but little provision or refreshments
of any kind, except goats and young
asses, which he says are good food, their
men having eat very freely thereof. That
it’s also but a poor place to wood and
water at, there being but one small drein:
and that your boats are always in danger,
from the greatness of the surf.” From
hence they took their departure on the 2d
of <i>April 1719</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>Shelvocke</i>, who was not in so much
haste, got no farther than the island of St.
<i>Jago</i>, on the 18th of the same month,
where he sold his small prize to the governer
for but 80 dollars, tho’ he says 150.
Then he sends away his kinsman <i>Adams</i>,
our Surgeon, to the chief town of this
island, to inform himself privately all that
he could learn of the <i>Success</i>; and to purchase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
sugar, without which there was no making
<i>Hipsy</i>. He return’d with the agreeable news
of <i>Clipperton</i>’s being gone from St. <i>Vincent</i>’s,
which, however, was concel’d from
us. And now <i>Shelvocke</i> being past all
fears of meeting <i>Clipperton</i>, resolves to put
it out of the power of chance to fall in
with him any more, by forming a design of
wintering at St. <i>Catharine</i>’s, on the coast
of <i>Brasil</i>: and accordingly, on the 20th
of <i>April</i>, weighs anchor and sails towards
the continent of <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>On the 5th of <i>June</i>, 1719, we met a
<i>Portuguese</i> merchantman near <i>Cape Frio</i>.
Our captain order’d the Emperor’s colours to
be hoisted, which, without any reflection,
look the most thief-like of any worn by
honest men: those of his Imperial Majesty
are a black spread eagle in a yellow field,
and those of the pyrates a yellow field and
black human skeleton; which at a small
distance are not easily distinguished, especially
in light gales of wind. So he brings
her to, by firing a musket thwart her forefoot;
sends aboard her the best busker (as he
himself call’d <i>Hatley</i>) with a boat’s crew; each
man arm’d with a cutlass and a case of pistols.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>The <i>Portuguese</i> not only imagines his
ship made prize, but thinks also how he
shall undergo that piece of discipline used
by the merry blades in the <i>West-Indies</i>, call’d
blooding and sweating; which is done by
making the captain, on the ill report of
his men, or his declining to discover where
his money is hid, to run the gantlet naked
thro’ the pyrate’s crew; each of them furnish’d
with a sail-needle, pricking him in
the buttocks, back and shoulders; thus bleeding
they put him into a sugar cask swarming
with cock-roaches, cover him with a
blanket, and there leave him to glut the vermin
with his blood.</p>

<p><i>Don Pedro</i>, to save his bacon, took care
however to be very officious or yare handed
(as we say) with his present: For no sooner
was <i>Hatley</i> on his quarter-deck, but the <i>Portuguese</i>
seamen began to hand into the boat
the fruits and refreshments they had aboard,
as plantins, bananas, lemons, oranges, pomgranates,
<i>&amp;c.</i> three or four dozen boxes of
marmalade and other sweatmeats; some
<i>Dutch</i> cheeses, and a large quantity of sugars.&mdash;&mdash;If
they had stopp’d here, it was well
enough, and might pass as a present; but after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
this there came above a dozen pieces of
silk, several of which were flower’d with
gold and silver, worth, at least, three pound
a yard, by retale; several dozen of <i>China</i>
plates and basins, a small <i>Japan</i> cabinet;
not to mention what the men took, who
on seeing the <i>Portuguese</i> so brisk at handing
their things into the boat, concluded
immediately they had as good a right to a
present, as any body else. So on board they
go, laying hold on what came next to hand:
In short, as ’twas all a present, I can’t see
who could pretend to restrain them. Among
other things, <i>Hatley</i> brought the last and
handsomest present of all, a purse of 300
moydors.</p>

<p>This convinc’d <i>Shelvocke</i> he was not deceiv’d
in calling <i>Hatley</i> the best busker, that
is, an impudent sharp fellow, (from the <i>Spanish</i>
word <i>buscar</i>, to look out sharp,) who,
perhaps, to reingratiate himself, did the
devil’s work; by whose laudable example our
boat’s crew robb’d the man of more than I can
pretend to say: but I remember the boat
was pretty well laden with one trade or
other; and none of the officers dared so
much as peep into her, till all was out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
While these things were handing into the
ship, a sham kind of quarel ensues between
our chieftains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shel. <i>Zounds! what do you mean by all
this, Sir?</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>By what, Sir?</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>Bringing me these baubles?</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>Sir they are very cheap.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>But I shall want my money for
other uses.</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>They’ll fetch double the cost at our
next port.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>You always act contrary to my orders.</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>Sir, I laid out my own money in the
same things as I did yours.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>It’s a hard case I have no officer
worth trusting; I can have nothing well
done, except I go out of the ship my self upon
every occasion.</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>I thought I had done for the better.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Shel. <i>I’ll have you know, Sir, I’ll be obey’d.</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>Your commands shall always be to
me as a law.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>Shel. <i>Where’s the account or bill of parcels?</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>Sir, not easily understanding one another,
we lump’d it; but I can draw one
out.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>Pray see you do.</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>Yes Sir.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>Whither is he bound?</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>To <span class="antiqua">Pernambucco</span>.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>Where belonging to?</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>To <span class="antiqua">Rio Janeiro</span>, whence he brought
these fruits and refreshments, which he presents
you with; desiring me to give you his
humble service, and that any thing in his
ship is at your disposal.</i></p>

<p>Shel. <i>Well, I believe he’s a very honest
fellow. Take the trumpet; tell him I thank
him, and that he may persue his voyage.</i></p>

<p>Hatley with the speaking trumpet. <i>O senior
capitan, O ho?</i></p>

<p>Capt. <i>Ho la senior.</i></p>

<p>Hat. <i>Amigo, Prosiga v, m, su camino con
dios</i>; that is, go on friend, and God bless
you.</p>

<p>Capt. muttering. <i>Y, v, m, el voestro con mille
demonios, perro ladron</i>; that is, go you
on, you thieving dog, and a thousand devils
along with you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>The <i>Portuguese</i> captain thus fleeced, hoisted
his topsails and away he goes, glad enough
’twas no worse. <i>Shelvocke</i> will have
it, p. 16. that there were but four or five
pieces of silk, but I have as good a memory
as himself: And supposing, tho’ not allowing
there was no more, and as the 80
dollars, prize money, was laid out in sugar
and some refreshments at St. <i>Jago</i>, whence
must the cost of those silks, china and cabinet
come? since I am positive we could
not muster up five pounds amongst us all
when we left <i>Plymouth</i>; answering in that
respect the character of right privatiers men;
but in no other instance.</p>

<p>He likewise says, p. 22. that <i>Hatley</i>’s moydors
were but 80 or 100, whereof ten were
given the cockswain, and six to each of the
boat’s crew, which shall, in the sequel, be
set in a fairer light, when <i>Hatley</i> and I
were taken prisoners, and 96 of the moydors
found upon him.</p>

<p>In a few days after this, all our petty officers
and boat’s crew appear’d in their fine
silk waistcoats, caps and breeches; our commander
himself in a silken skin, as the
word <i>peaud’soy</i> implies, and the beau
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
gentleman his son, in a cinnamon colour’d
sute of fine silk, all wondrous gallant and
gay!</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> soon perceived by the whispering
and shyness of his officers in the cabin,
that this management did not please them,
tho’ none of us dared to speak the least
about it: So to make us easy, as he would
have it (tho’ in reality to make us accomplices)
he order’d us to bring into the cabin
all our scarlet sutes;&mdash;the Gentlemen who
fitted us out, having given the chief officers,
to the number of twenty five in both
ships, a scarlet sute each;&mdash;When he
made us the following speech.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>“We have yet a long voyage in hand,
and ’tis uncertain where or how we shall
be furnish’d with cloaths, when these we
have are worn out or impair’d. To shew
you therefore that I have your interest as
much at heart as my own, I have consider’d
that your sleeve cuffs and pocket flaps
will be first subject to the injuries of time;
which to prevent, I here make each of
you a present of as much gold and silver
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
flower’d silk as will serve to cover them.
To you gentlemen sea officers, scarlet with
gold; and to you gentlemen of the marines,
green with silver.” For this kind offer
we all return’d humble thanks, beging
leave at the same time to be excus’d from
this piece of finery: but all in vain; for our
captain would not be outdone in point of
generosity: we must appear something like
himself. And he in his black <i>peaud’soy</i> sute
trim’d with large silver loops down the breast,
made a ridiculous figure enough.</p>

<p>He has somewhere, I think, call’d me a
<i>Cape of Good Hope man</i>; which noted headland
I never saw, and therefore know not
what he means by it: But ’tis certain this
transaction with the <i>Portuguese</i> proved <i>Shelvocke</i>
a right <i>Cape Frio</i> man, which I believe
is very easily understood.</p>

<p>Tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> never kept any journal,
or intended to give the gentlemen any fair
account of his actions; yet at his arrival in
<i>England</i>, finding this story was blown, he
was under a necessity of removing from
himself the imputation of Pyracy as well
as he could: and therefore confidently tells
the world, page 23. that he made a protest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
against <i>Hatley</i>, and deliver’d it to captain
<i>Clipperton</i>, in the <i>South-Sea</i>, which, if true,
instead of mending makes the story worse.</p>

<p>Now, this is mere invention, founded upon
the difficulty there seems to be of confuting
him; for <i>Clipperton</i> died in <i>June
1722</i>. I was left a prisoner at <i>Lima</i> in <i>Peru</i>,
and probably sacrificed. As for <i>Hatley</i>,
he indeed did arrive at <i>London</i> in 23; but
went immediately for <i>Jamaica</i>, never shewing
his face to any one of the owners: so
that <i>Shelvocke</i> imagin’d there was no witness
of consequence to reveal his craft and
treachery; having had three or four years to
frame and complete this romantic libel.</p>

<p>However, I desire this invisible gentleman
to answer me these following questions.</p>

<p>Why such protest was not made while
<i>Hatley</i> was on board the <i>Speedwell</i>, to be
confronted by a cloud of witnesses?</p>

<p>Why that protest (if any such ever was
made) should be deliver’d to captain <i>Clipperton</i>,
whom <i>Shelvocke</i> from page 22. to
25 of his preface, and all along has made
such a sad insignificant fellow; and to whom
he had too much pride to think himself
accountable? and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>Why was not a copy of that protest printed
in his book, fairly vouch’d by his chief
officers, as well as that long impertinent
one against the governer of <i>Sansonate</i>; on
the opposite part of the globe? page 340.
I really believe one would have been much
more to his credit than the other.</p>

<p>We arrive next at St. <i>Catherine</i>’s on the
coast of <i>Brazil</i>, lat. 27 : 30 S: where our
captain shews us a masterpiece of machiavilian
politicks; making by the following
stratagem the greatest number of his ships
company rogues against their own inclinations:
and knowing this could not be suddenly
brought about, he had long been preparing
for that purpose his instrument, one
<i>Mathew Stewart</i>; who, as his own steward,
waited on us in the cabin, till our arrival at
the <i>Canary</i> islands, when and where <i>Shelvocke</i>
had promoted him to be first mate
of the ship, tho’ not seaman enough to distinguish
between a brace and a bowline.
This was done to gain him greater credit
with the men; tho’ it was a direct prejudice
to three or four clever young fellows
who were good seamen and artists. His accepting
a steward’s place at first is an undeniable
argument he was no seaman. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>The weight of my argument depending
much on proving <i>Stewart</i> no seaman, the
reader I hope will pardon my inserting this
account of him. He was the son or apprentice
of a shopkeeper at <i>Glasgow</i> in <i>North
Britain</i>, and went supercargo of a small
ship to <i>Maryland</i> or <i>Virginia</i>. On his return
from his first voyage he touch’d at <i>London</i>,
where he squander’d away most of his
money: so not caring to look his friends
in the face, he desir’d of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
to be imploy’d in our expedition; who made
him his steward. He was a young man of
good sense and good education: so that it’s
plain if he were qualified for doing the duty
of a sea-officer, his ambition would not
have suffer’d him to accept a steward’s place:
and how fit this man was for first mate of a
private ship of war, I leave other judges
than my self to determine. In this article
I appeal to Mr. <i>James Moffat</i> and Company,
mercers in <i>St. Martins le Grand</i>.</p>

<p>This spark had not been long tampering
with the men, before he brought them to
any thing he pleased; especially when they
saw he always had the captain’s ear, and
was so very much in his favour also; which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
gave us all a kind of emulation, wondering
what rare qualifications <i>Shelvocke</i> could
discover in a fellow, who but a few days
before rinsed our glasses and filled us our
wine.</p>

<p>But the mystery was here unravell’d, on
our finding a round robine sent up by the
men to <i>Shelvocke</i>, by this minion of his.
Robine is a mutinous letter, at the bottom
of which every subscriber sets his hand
in a round ring, to avoid being called first
in the mutiny. The tenor of this letter
set forth their diffidence of the gentlemen
owners, and their fears of being all cheated:
which the fellows before had no notion
of, if not prompted to these apprehensions,
as I said before, by <i>Shelvocke</i>
himself; who finding all that he had done and
said fail of the desired effect, had now made
use of this emissary <i>Stewart</i>, to poison the
men’s minds, when otherwise they would
have been quiet at their duty. I need no
stronger argument to prove the honest and
orderly disposition of the ship’s company,
than this writer’s own words, page 4. who
says himself, they were four fifths landmen;
whose first complaint, ’tis well known, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
always for want of provisions; which they,
however do in a more submissive manner.
But this was quite out of the case; as what
they never could or did complain of. Besides,
if the boatswain and his mates were
supported in the discharge of their duty,
they were sufficient enough to keep them
under. Add to this, that we were nine officers
at his table, an unusual number for such a
ship, being so design’d that we might effectually
oppose any intended mutinies: but
this despotic man had so intimidated us,
that had we offered our service, by promising
to assist him in bringing those pretended
mutiniers to reason, the very proposal
from us would have been construed
a real mutiny. And further it may be easily
imagined, that no one would have had
the confidence to deliver this arbitrary captain
any proposal savouring of discontent
and mutiny, except a pupil so instructed;
and such was <i>Stewart</i>, whom I might more
properly call <i>quartermaster</i>, since he officiated
as one who had rather been used to the
<i>Jamaica</i> discipline, than a well regulated
private ship of war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>None therefore but a man void of truth
and shame could impute, as <i>Shelvocke</i> does,
all his innovations and wilful mismanagements
to the mutinies of his men; when
any six of his cabin officers, having the
small arms always in our own custody,
would have drove the rascals over the forecastle,
without deserving to be recorded
as heroes.</p>

<p>In fine, new regulations and articles were
made and introduced by <i>Stewart</i>, allowing
an additional perquisit to <i>Shelvocke</i> himself
of 5 <i>per cent</i>. upon the whole capture to
be made; which, after his example, we all
sign’d.</p>

<p>To give the better countenance to this
preceding, <i>Shelvocke</i> asked us officers of
his mess, whom we would chuse for our
agent? to this not one of them even dared
to say a word, waiting his own direction
to point out the man: At last I said, that
since the whole ship’s company, except our
selves, had vested such a power in Mr. <i>Stewart</i>,
I could see no reason why he might
not make one trouble of it, and pay us
all our respective shares. To this he answer’d
with a menacing sneer, ay by god, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
suppose you want that preferment your self.
I replyd, I was so well satisfyd with my own
shares, and the imployment given me
by the Gentlemen at home, that I never coveted
or thought of any other. This too
gave a great deal of offense. However <i>Shelvocke</i>
modestly told us, that unless we chose
his own nephew <i>Adams</i> the surgeon, we
should make a voyage for a <i>knife</i> and <i>sheath</i>.
It was no sooner said than done: the doctor
drew up an Instrument immediately, and
we were constraind to sign it.</p>

<p>But the merriest agent of all, was <i>Shelvocke</i>
himself, who calling the next day to
Mr. <i>Hendrie</i>, the Gentlemen’s agent, told
him that he himself would now be agent
for the owners, and <i>Hendrie</i> might be purser
of the ship, if he pleased: at which arbitrary
usurpation, Mr. <i>Hendrie</i> was very
much shockt; well knowing that as agent
he had a right to twenty shares; but as purser,
only what <i>Shelvocke</i> was pleased to
allow; for as yet we had no such officer
mentiond aboard the ship: wherefore
seeing the difficulties we lay under, he believed
it was in vain to struggle, and only
made this gentle return.&mdash;&mdash;Sir, I hope I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
have done nothing unbecoming my duty,
either in my office, or personally to you;
and therefore beg leave to remind you, that
those gentlemen who gave you your commission
in this ship, made me also their
agent for all such captures as she should
make: for which <i>Hendrie</i> got no satisfaction,
but <i>Shelvocke</i>’s adding with an oath
that if he did not accept a purser, he should
neither be one nor the other. Whereupon
Mr. <i>Hendrie</i> demanded, in his own right,
to have a council of the officers calld who
should hear and determine the case; which
being absolutely refused, <i>Hendrie</i> drew up
a protest against the captain’s arbitrary procedings,
a copy of which he gave into his
own hand, and deliverd one to each officer
of his mess: which is a proof of <i>Hendrie</i>’s
honest spirit, and that he was worthy of the
post the gentlemen gave him.</p>

<p>My reader may possibly question how so
much craft, so much treachery, such an
abuse of power, could meet together in
the person of one man: but I here solemnly
aver every circumstance of this affair to
be true; and appeal to all persons concernd
therein, besides the depositions aforesaid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Nor is it so much to be wonder’d at, if
we consider a commander of a ship in a far
distant latitude, with unlimited power, bad
views, ill nature and ill principles all concurring.&mdash;&mdash;I
say, it’s not to be wondered at
whatever such a Man does, for he is past
all restraint.</p>

<p>A late instance of this kind is captain
<i>Jayne</i>, of <i>Bristol</i> who, in a most extraordinary
lingering manner, cruelly starved and tortured
his cabin boy to death; nor could his
whole ship’s company hinder it, tho’ it was
long a doing: however, when ashore, the
men were freed from that tyrannical power,
and were bold enough to speak the truth,
which hanged him.</p>

<p>But to return. Thus was <i>Shelvocke</i>’s great
estate to be got suddenly, without any one
in the ship to be a check upon him, or even
a witness of the <i>quantum</i> or <i>quomodo</i>, <i>how</i>
or <i>how much</i>; for now ’tis evident all must
pass through his own and his two creatures
hands; <i>Shelvocke</i> being agent for the owners,
his kinsman for us of the cabin, and <i>Stewart</i>
agent for the petty officers and men.</p>

<p>Nor did he stop here; for he also proposed
to reduce me from captain of marines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
to lieutenant, and the two lieutenants
of marines to petty officers: but I having
a letter from <i>Edward Hughes</i>, Esq; directed
to captain <i>Mitchel</i>, then the commanding
officer of the <i>Speedwel</i>, to receive me and
my servant on board, and to enter me on
the roll of equipage, as captain of marines,
which I produced, he desisted, and I heard
no more of it: but this I remember, that
in two days time my pocket-book was stole
from me, wherein I kept the said letter,
and some memorandums of our captain’s
very fine procedings.</p>

<p>Instead of coming into this harbour of
St. <i>Catharine</i>’s, it’s plain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s duty was
to make the best of his way to the southward,
that he might be early with the enemy
the <i>Spaniard</i>; for <i>Clipperton</i>, about this
time, was actually in the great <i>South Sea</i>.
But our commander found it more comfortable
to pass the winter away near that
glorious luminary the sun, than at the hazard
of losing his liquors to follow his orders
and his commodore into the frozen
straits of <i>Magellan</i>, where <i>Clipperton</i> and
his men suffer’d extreme hardships, being
quite destitute of those supports which we
super-abounded with.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>To palliate these mismanagements <i>Shelvocke</i>
tells ye, p. 51. that to save his <i>English</i>
provisions, he bought twenty one head
of black cattle; which, I am sure, was but
four: one hundred and fifty bushels of cassader
meal; which was no more than five
or six: and as for other provisions (excepting
three or four hogs) ’tis a forgery; for
the inhabitants hearing from our deserters
of the <i>Cape Frio</i> story, would no longer
deal with us; tho’ Monsieur <i>Laport</i>, one of
our lieutenants, who was a roman catholic,
apply’d to the <i>padre</i>, one Sunday after
divine service, to sell <i>Shelvocke</i> what he
wanted.</p>

<p>He says, in his home made story, page
48. that <i>Hatley</i> burn’d the <i>Portuguese</i>
house, tho’ we have often heard him blame
<i>Randal</i>, his lieutenant, for so doing, he
being really the man. This indeed was but
a brutish return to the people, who out of
fear or complaisance had quitted their house,
for our coopers and sail-makers to work in,
and likewise served us for a guard house.
But <i>Shelvocke</i> says nothing of <i>Coldsea</i> the
master, the most quarelsome turbulent
fellow in the ship, because whatever imperfect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
reckoning they had, was kept by him,
having made the tour of the globe together.
This man at St. <i>Catharine</i>’s was
doom’d by <i>Shelvocke</i> for transportation to
<i>Europe</i>, because he insulted his kinsman
<i>Adams</i>; and to save himself an oath, that
he never should come over the ship’s side
again, he suffer’d him, at the intreaty of
Mr. <i>Dodd</i>, to enter at a gun-port.</p>

<p>As to the awning, which he set up page
51. and which he intends as a justification
of his coming in here, it proved rather a
nusance than a benefit; for as the place afforded
not the proper materials, he could
not make it staunch and tight, so that the
rain, as it fell from the clouds, was not
half so troublesom, as the streams it made
through this imperfect piece of work, into
the poor men’s necks: besides, it very
much hinder’d our walking the deck. Captain
<i>Clipperton</i> had twice made the voyage
before, and therefore was something of a
judge; and he, as well as the gentlemen at
home, thought the <i>Speedwel</i> completely
enough fitted out without any additions
of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>It’s merry enough to observe how <i>Shelvocke</i>
p. 25. makes Mons. <i>La Jonquiere</i>,
who was a gentleman of good sense, commander
of a fifty gun ship in the King of
<i>Spain</i>’s service, and in time of war with
<i>England</i>, hold forth to the supposed mutinous
crew of an <i>English</i> privatier, then
going to take, sink, burn and destroy as
many of the ships belonging to the subjects
of the king his master, as should have the
misfortune of falling into their clutches;
and to this effect, that they should behave
themselves dutifully and obediently towards
their honest commander, who was leading
them to make their fortunes. The absurdity
of this is plain enough, when I consider
there were not above four or five in our ship
at most, who understood any thing of <i>French</i>:
and I am sure <i>La Jonquiere</i> did not speak
a word of <i>English</i>: besides, he had something
else to mind; all this being only a
drunken frolick, occasion’d by the <i>Frenchman</i>’s
coming aboard us to make merry.</p>

<p>Another, but a worse blunder he commits
in the speech, he pretends was made
to captain <i>Hatley</i>, by Monsieur <i>La Riviere</i>,
commander of a <i>Portuguese</i> man of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
war of forty guns, which arrived there some
time before we sail’d, p. 26. “That it
was very likely he might receive a gratuity
from the matter of the ship<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>,
to prevent his being troublesome: but
that his captain’s coming immediately into
a port of the same nation, was a convincing
demonstration to him (besides
the meanness of the story) that there could
not be any public or general base design,
and that he was far from mistrusting
there could be any private one, and
desired him to give his humble service to
me, and tell me, that he had a great deal
of honour and respect for me; and begg’d
I would let him have the conveniencies
I had ashore (when I had done with them)
if the <i>French</i> captain had not preingaged
them.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
That is the <i>Portuguese</i> off <i>Cape Frio</i>.</p></div>

<p>Now, ’tis very unlikely that a captain of
a man of war, of double the force, and in
a harbour of his own nation, should beg
leave in so obsequious a manner for conveniencies,
which he might easily command; and
I know of no conveniencies there, except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the house which <i>Randal</i> burn’d; for <i>Shelvocke</i>
owns himself, p. 57. that he saw no
house or fortification, except the woods.
And whereas he (for reasons best known to
himself) will have it that <i>Hatley</i> was so odious
to the <i>Portuguese</i> inhabitants, charging
him with things quite foreign to the truth;
it was not his case alone: we were all equally
hated by them; for they were by this
time acquainted with the ill treatment the
<i>Portuguese</i> captain met with from us; as
he himself plainly allows, p. 45. saying,
“I made no doubt but that captain <i>Hatley</i>’s
affair would be reported to this gentleman,
by some of the inhabitants; and
therefore told him, that I expected he
would go and vindicate himself to the
<i>Portuguese</i> captain, to prevent any disturbances
that might arise, by the account
of his mismanagement on board the <i>Portuguese</i>
we met at sea. To which he
readily replied, that he would. Therefore
to give him an opportunity of
doing it, I sent a complement by Monsieur
<i>La Riviere</i>.”</p>

<p>Now had the business with the <i>Portuguese</i>,
off of <i>Cape Frio</i>, been a fair merchandize,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
as <i>Shelvocke</i> relates it, p. 16. how
comes he here to call it mismanagement,
and cautiously to send <i>Hatley</i> with a complement
to vindicate himself?</p>

<p>A <i>Creolian Spaniard</i>, servant to one
of captain <i>Jonquiere</i>’s lieutenants, having
robb’d his Master of a hundred quadruples,
each of which is four pistoles, absconded
in the woods, designing to take
his passage with us round <i>Cape Horne</i>, to
his own country again. <i>La Jonquiere</i> and
the lieutenant applied to <i>Shelvocke</i>, desiring,
that in case the servant should be found,
and the money upon him, he would
secure him and take it from him; giving
<i>Shelvocke</i> directions how to remit the money
to <i>France</i>, on his arrival in <i>Europe</i>, all
which he faithfully promised to perform.
As soon as the <i>Ruby</i> sail’d, the fellow appear’d
to our men at the watering place,
with one moiety of the money in his pocket,
designing, I suppose, to pay for his passage
with it: but <i>Shelvocke</i> not content
with that, order’d him to be seiz’d to the
jears, where he was whipp’d and pickled,
which was repeated every <i>Munday</i> for a
month: but the fellow, who had run the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
risque of hanging for it, and knew the
value of money as well as the captain, stood
the lash without confessing he had any more:
so he remain’d on board and had his passage.
Thus was <i>Shelvocke</i>, with his wholesome
severities, teaching the <i>Spaniard</i> the
heinousness of defrauding his master; when
we all very well knew <i>Shelvocke</i> deserved
the same discipline himself: which brings
to my mind an excellent distich of Dr.
<i>Garth</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><i>But little villains must submit to fate,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>That great ones may injoy the world in state.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>This story I mention, because he has been
cunning enough to skip it over, and only
says, p. 31. “’twas well for him he had
some money from one of the <i>Ruby</i>’s people,”
which must be the said lieutenant’s
servant.”</p>

<p>I think it needs explanation, how such
friendship could exist between two warlike
ships of nations already declared enemies,
especially since <i>Shelvocke</i> has said nothing
of it; fancying the world might ascribe it
to his own wise conduct, or rather his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
gasconading <i>Monsieur</i> into that complaisant
temper.</p>

<p>I must therefore acquaint the reader that
<i>La Jonquiere</i> had on board his ship a good
sum of the King’s money, and near twenty
fathers; some of which had been many
years in <i>Peru</i>, <i>Chili</i> and <i>Paraguay</i> missionaries
<i>de propaganda fide</i>, and had well
fill’d their purses, the gospel there proving
very great gain: besides many other wealthy
passengers from those parts. These pacific
gentry did by no means like the noise of
great guns, or changing the pleasures of
this world for the uncertainties of immortality:
and Monsieur, no doubt, had found
how to turn that disposition of theirs into
a good article in his accounts. Besides, to
my knowledge he had not at his first coming
in, above sixty well men, tho’ he had
near 400 aboard, passengers included; which
ill state of his people was chiefly occasion’d
by his passing <i>Cape Horne</i> in the winter
with indifferent provision, which the
<i>Spaniards</i> in <i>America</i> know not how to cure
or pack up.</p>

<p>Before we sail’d, there arrived a <i>French</i>
merchant ship from St. <i>Malo</i>, commanded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
by Monsieur <i>Dumain Girard</i>, bound for
<i>Chili</i>; who meeting <i>La Jonquiere</i> at sea,
had got an order on <i>Shelvocke</i> to pay him
the money: But <i>Shelvocke</i> refus’d it, saying,
he would remit it, on his return to <i>England</i>,
to the lieutenant, whose money it was;
which, if he has done, is very extraordinary,
being contrary to his dealings in other
cases, with those who have had his acquaintance
in this voyage.</p>

<p>At length we sail’d from St. <i>Catharine</i>’s,
but saw no more ships to try the project of
the Emperor’s colours with: so that nothing
to my present purpose happens, till
we got round <i>Cape Horne</i>. Where, as we
approach the enemy, <i>Shelvocke</i> fearing
some of us might be spies upon his actions,
thought it the wisest way to get rid of those
whom he had hitherto observed uneasy at
his procedings; and sets his son <i>George</i> and
<i>Adams</i> his kinsman, to tell us, in a formal
manner; That such of us, as did not like
to serve under captain <i>Shelvocke</i>, should
soon be found with other imbarkations.
And this was often repeated.</p>

<p>Let the reader then be pleased to observe,
that he has placed this affair p. 62.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
before we got to <i>Cape Horne</i>: but this is
another proof that he kept no regular journal,
for all this happened when we were in the
great <i>South-Sea</i>, and liquors began to grow
scarce.</p>

<p>He begins, p. 60: where he says, as we
advanced to the southward, the men’s stomachs
increased with the sharpness of the
air. Here he says I grew a champion for
the officers, and wanted a greater allowance
at his table: which is intirely a false
insinuation, for no one was better pleased
with the allowance, and so were the people:
and having served as an officer several
years in the navy, I must needs know that
any man, in such an expedition, guilty of
what <i>Shelvocke</i> lays to my charge, well deserved
to be shot through the head. Afterwards
he aggravates this story, by saying <i>Betagh</i>
had a voracious appetite, and eat more
than came to his share. I need not wonder
at any thing <i>Shelvocke</i> says on this head;
for he being a very small eater himself, fancied
all other people gluttons: I verily believe
he never eat above two ounces in a
day, as long as <i>hipsy</i> lasted; but was a great
drinker all the voyage; whereas I never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
loved drinking: so that the difference between
us is only this, I eat more than he,
and he drank more than I: and when I am
to tell the story, the reflection is turned:
He appears a drunkard, and I a moderate
man.</p>

<p>Now this is such mean pitiful scandal
for an author who sets out with the noble
title of a voyage round the world, that it
must convince mankind how trifling his
observations have been, how ill grounded
his malice is to me, and how far fetched
his revenge. ’Tis a poor reflection upon a
man, who in his appetite is as moderate
as most are, and hardly deserves the answer
I have given it.</p>

<p>’Tis in the same page, where he says I
had the insolence to tell him publickly, that
the <i>voyage</i> should be <i>short</i> with him. I
frankly own I said the words, and scorn
to deny it: but said them not in that order
he has maliciously put them. For to
avoid his brow-beating me, I often used to
sit cross the spitsail-yard arm in fine weather,
with a book, or the fishgigg to strike
the fish; and one time coming down pretty
thirsty, I found them all drinking hugger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
mugger in the cabin, upon which I
said, Faith, now I find I must drink in spight;
which <i>Shelvocke</i> furiously resented, as an argument
that I would drink in spight of him,
whether he would or no: upon which I
thus addrest him, and said, since we are past
the <i>Cape</i>, the most dangerous and fatiguing
part of our navigation, and are so near the
enemy, I beg of you, Sir, to let us live as
easy as possible; for now I hope in God the
<i>voyage</i> will be <i>short</i> with us. These were
infallibly my very words: but according to
his way of perverting them, what must the
reader imagine, but that I designed to throw
my captain over-board, or murder him?</p>

<p>As <i>Shelvocke</i> has turn’d it, it can bear
no better meaning. This I think a very
cruel mischievous way of perverting a man’s
words, and not unlike the Devil’s method
of quoting scripture.</p>

<p>However, my good captain, for these and
other reasons that I have set forth, was
pleased to order me under confinement:
and it may be here thought strange, considering
what a troublesome creature he has
represented me, that I bore this with such
temper and submission; ’tis much he don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
say I mutinied. But I was taken into custody,
laid at my full length on the arms-chest
at the bulk-head in the steerage, and confined
just there: and, what with the height
of the chest and the bedding, the upper
deck was so very close, I had hardly room
to lie extended upon it, there being no
possibility of sitting up, so that my victuals
was brought me there; and when I offered
to make water upon deck, the centinel
was always close at my heels with a
drawn sword: and thus I continued twelve
or fourteen days, no body daring to speak
to me, except Mr. <i>Hendrie</i>, who before
this was also turn’d out of the mess.</p>

<p>Liberty is what we are all fond of; but
the ridiculous manner of my confinement
made it more irksom and tedious: so that it
was natural for me to try any method for inlargement.
And if <i>Shelvocke</i> had proceded legally,
I should have been try’d by a council of
our own officers, according to captain <i>Rogers</i>’s
method, which we were order’d to follow:
but being past all hopes of that, I soon
found it plain, that all he wanted was an humble
letter under my hand; for by what his son
<i>George</i> had said (that we should be soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
found with other imbarkations) I believe I was
intended a sacrifice to the <i>Spaniard</i>: therefore
finding by <i>Adams</i>, that a letter was
expected, I e’en writ five or six lines in as
handsome a manner as I could, but not that
long forg’d letter, p. 26. fram’d and contrived
just to serve his own purpose, by
making him appear innocent and me guilty:
the original of which, if he can produce
of my hand writing, I here promise
to own all the rest of his book to be true.
And doubtless, if I ever wrote such a letter,
<i>Shelvocke</i> would be wise enough to
preserve it, not only for his own credit, but
to put me to confusion.&mdash;&mdash;Wherefore I here
dare him to it: and whatever I did write,
the reader may easily see that the nature of
my circumstances extorted it.</p>

<p>As for the additional allowance, which
he speaks of, p. 62. ’tis inserted there on
purpose to make that inference, p. 74.
where he says he could not procede directly
to the northward, because the supernumerary
allowance aforementioned had wasted
our wood and water; and so truly <i>Shelvocke</i>
says he was obliged to go to <i>Narbrough</i>’s
island to recruit these two articles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>Sure this man has the greatest share of
hypocrisy that I ever met with. This story
is a mere vile fiction made here at home,
to excuse himself to the Owners, who have
all been inraged at his conduct. <i>Shelvocke</i>
was still fearful of meeting his consort;
and goes to <i>Narbrough</i>’s island, for nothing
but to loiter time away, and avoid any probable
chance of seeing <i>Clipperton</i>: besides
no private ships have any business to touch
to the southward, there being nothing at
all to be got; and by his own account you
see it was a foolish attempt, for he came
back as he went, and narrowly escaped
losing his ship.</p>

<p>While he is going round <i>Cape Horne</i>, he
gravely tells us, p. 73. how melancholy
it was to be without his consort. “I must
own (says he) that this navigation is
truly melancholy, and was the more so
to us, who were by our selves, without a
companion, which would have somewhat
diverted our thoughts from the reflexion of
being in such a remote part of the world,
and as it were, separated from the rest
of mankind, to struggle with the dangers
of a stormy climate.”&mdash;&mdash;poor <i>Shelvocke!</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Now this is all such a jest, that it
makes the reader laugh: for after all your
whining, ’tis plain it better suted your
scheme to be without captain <i>Clipperton</i>,
who having no store of wine or
brandy, must needs be very melancholy in
this wretched climate; and therefore these
reflections of yours would seem much more
natural from <i>Clipperton</i>, who wanted your
company more than you did his.</p>

<p>Still to confirm this, as we came into
the parallel of the island of <i>Chiloe</i>, on the
continent, latitude 40 South, <i>Shelvocke</i>
would go in there, and all the arguments
we could use to the contrary, signified nothing:
for late as it was, if we had gone
to <i>Fernandes</i>, there were some hopes of
meeting captain <i>Clipperton</i>, that being the
last place of rendezvous, and where only
all private ships do first touch for wood and
water, without going to any part of the
continent for fear of alarming the coast:
besides, he well knew that no <i>British</i>, <i>French</i>,
or any other ship ever touch’d there; nor hath
any chart ever described it: yet he would
venture in, where we almost miraculously
escaped with our lives; and all this, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the rest of his schemes, to avoid joining
captain <i>Clipperton</i>.</p>

<p>We were no sooner enter’d, but we
found our selves surrounded with terrible
breakers; for such is the uncertainty and
rapidity of the several tides or currents meeting
there, that ’twould at once astonish and
baffle the most judicious mariner to describe
it.</p>

<p>We were first taken under the bow with
a current setting from the lee of one island:
(there being several) then immediately under
the quarter with another, so that the
ship could not answer her helm. At last
the most powerful of these currents horsed
her away on the west shore, into three fathom
and a half, where the torrent ran
with such impetuosity, and the ground was
so foul, that the sand appear’d on the surface
from the bottom: all which together afforded
us a dismal prospect. However the
anchor brought her up, which if we had
not let go when we did, every man of us
must inevitably have perish’d: for had she
touch’d the bottom there, she must in a
moment have gone to pieces, or overset
by the strength of the current.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>According to this description, the reader,
tho’ unacquainted with seamanship, will
easily conceive that every soul of us was in
the utmost danger by the unwarrantable
procedings of this one obstinate man: Tho’
to do justice to my enemy, I must allow
captain <i>Shelvocke</i> to be as able a seaman
and artist as perhaps any whatever; which
still makes his guilt in this affair the more
enormous.</p>

<p>To confirm what I have already said, the
ship, while riding here, kept continually on
the sheer, till the cable was so rubb’d and
gaul’d by the rocks, that it was stranded, and
then it parted: But <i>Shelvocke</i> will have it,
p. 80. that the great strain it then bore,
was occasion’d by the wind blowing fresh:
whereas if it had blown more than a moderate
gale, we could not have kept our
topsails loose; which very providentially
saved all our lives: for as soon as we found
her adrift, we back’d her off to the eastward,
the tide being chang’d; but had she
cast with her head to the westward, our
voyage must infallibly have terminated there
with our lives.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>As to the reasons he gives for going to
this place, they are all invented and made
at home. He says, p. 77. <i>La Fontaine</i>,
the <i>Frenchman</i> we had out of the <i>Ruby</i>,
gave him great hopes and ideas of the
place, for that he had been there; but I
am sure that ship never touch’d to the
southward, farther than <i>Conception</i>: and
then he says that <i>Frenchman</i>’s assurances
prevail’d upon us all unanimously to go to
this island: whereas, as I said before, we
all too well knew the danger and vanity
of it, (to call it no worse) and labour’d in
vain to dissuade him from it.</p>

<p>I have given the reader many specimens
of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s hypocrisy and baseness; here
follows an instance of his ill manners. At
our arrival in the harbour of <i>Chiloe</i>, <i>Shelvocke</i>,
by the advice of <i>La Port</i> our third
lieutenant, hoisted <i>French</i> colours, and assumes
the name of <i>Janis le Breton</i>; and
the <i>Speedwel</i> he calls the <i>St. Rose</i>, in which
the said <i>Le Breton</i> had made several voyages
in these Seas.</p>

<p>Here he puts in practice the strangest
discipline that ever I heard of. As soon
as we were in the harbour, the night approaching,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
our captain orders the watch
upon deck to divide into three parties: on
the forecastle, a midships, and on the quarterdeck;
and to call out every five minutes
to look out well afore there, look out well
abaft there, each party in their turn answering
aloud, Ay,&mdash;Ay; and this to be continued
every night. This hollowing and
hooping so terrified the people ashore, that
they never dared to appear by day; and had
nothing to do all night, but drive their
cattle into the woods too far for us to follow
them, and secure their best effects as
well as they could. Add to this the terrible
scarecrow figures we made by day in
our grenadiers caps, which he made us all
put on to fright the enemy, and which
were at least two and twenty inches high.
So that the people aboard the canoe, which
first came to us, and carried <i>Shelvocke</i>’s first
letter to the governer, were so scared at us,
that they never had courage enough to return
with an answer: but erected a pole with
a white flag of peace, in the night time,
and at the foot of it left a letter from the
governer, with a present of twelve large
hams for our captain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>By this letter, p. 84. it was great condescension
in the governer to take that notice
of us: for tho’ we indeavour’d to pass for
the ship above mention’d, yet by this odness
of discipline, and monstrous kind of caps,
I rather think they took us for some wild
creatures from a country yet unknown.
Now if <i>Shelvocke</i> had at heart the interest
of his owners, he would have improved
this disposition of the governer, who had,
as it were kindly broke the ice, by making
the first present: For all the governers for
his <i>Spanish</i> Majesty are strictly forbid to
deal in any wise; but particularly ordered
to oppose all nations having any provisions
whatever, as being most jealous of that
clandestine way of trade.</p>

<p>The governer, no doubt, expected some
sort of return for his present: at least a gentleman
like one: for none of the governers
in this part of the world come to
take the air, but to make their fortunes.
But our <i>Janis Le Breton</i> returns about a
pound and half of butter, at least eighteen
months in salt; a pound of black pepper,
and two <i>Dutch</i> cheeses about the bigness
of ninepin bowls. Now any one may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
imagine how stupidly ridiculous this appeared
to a gentleman, governer of a province
flowing indeed with milk and honey. However,
in his next letter he thanks our captain
in terms as civil as the former.</p>

<p>If <i>Shelvocke</i> had sent the governer a handsome
piece of silk of the <i>Cape Frio</i> acquisition,
for his lady, it would have been a genteel
return, and sutable to the gaiety of the
<i>American Spaniards</i>. I make no doubt we
should have had fat beeves and hogs, as
many as we wanted: but the whimsical
duty which our commander order’d us
to perform, together with his own aukward
behaviour, made us really appear both
frightful and ridiculous: and if he had acted
as he ought, what pretext could remain for
his loitering here, and not going immediately
to the place of rendezvous? But his
coming in and all he did here, was intirely
vain amusement, idly wasting five
or six weeks, ordering us every day ashore,
in our fools caps, in the persuit of game
or shooting the wild boar.</p>

<p>So that what we were chiefly supplied
with, was the produce of two small islands
on the starboard-side going in; for which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
we were indebted to lieutenant <i>Brook</i>’s
good management, who at our first coming
secured all the small imbarkations he
found in the bay, which hindered the inhabitants
carrying off their cattle.</p>

<p>I come now to the story, p. 98. relating to
my self, which he has drest up with silly
falsities only to expose me. In short, <i>Shelvocke</i>
order’d me and lieutenant <i>Dodd</i>, with
as many marines as the pinnace could carry,
to go ashore at the flag place, to exercise only;
whereas he falsly says it was to get supplies
from the <i>Spaniards</i>. I who had never learned,
seeing the rest of our officers had taken
it in their heads to learn, thought it would
appear singular, if I did not learn too: so
we exercised about half a dozen times making
but one line of about fifteen men (tho’
he talks of ranks) and went strait aboard.
The real design of this was quite otherwise
than he would have the world believe: for
the second or third day after our arrival,
two canoes approach’d us to form some
judgment of our designs; and for that reason
we were order’d to exercise ashore, in
this manner, to appear as formidable as we
could: but it was in hopes the <i>Spaniards</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
taking it for a formal landing to plunder
them, would knock us on the head, which
was easily enough to be done; for <i>Shelvocke</i>
when he sent us, said there was no
need of any powder or shot, tho’ we cautiously
took some unknown to him: besides,
had it been only to exercise, it might have
been done aboard, or at the watering place
the other side the bay, where there was none
but our own people.</p>

<p>There was no reason to send us in the
very mouths of the <i>Spaniards</i>, with so few
men, unfurnish’d (as he thought) with ammunition,
to a place where only danger
could be expected, if it was not with secret
hopes to have us cut off: For <i>Dodd</i>
and I being two of those who were a check
upon him, he did not want above half his
number of men to carry on his separate
views and base designs. And tho’ he says
<i>Hatley</i> commanded the boat, I seriously
aver that <i>Hatley</i> was not among us: but it
was the pinnace, and no soul with us but
the marines, who rowed her ashore and
off again, by eleven a clock the same morning,
tho’ he says I was left all night.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>But fully to prove that <i>Shelvocke</i> never
kept any journal at all; I do own that about
five weeks after this time, I being ashore
on one of the two islands on the other side
the bay to keep a guard at the watering-place,
where was no body but our own men;
captain <i>Hatley</i> came in the evening for a
longboat load of wood and water, when it
began to blow fresh, and a great swell to tumble
in, which obliged him to hawl the longboat
further out to her grapling, to prevent
her thumping against the rocks; so that
the men were forced to wade middle high
to carry in their burthens of wood: the
swell still increasing, I did not care to be
sowsed over head and ears, and desired
captain <i>Hatley</i> to go off without me, which
he did; and lieutenant <i>Brook</i> came in an
hour’s time afterwards and carried me and
my guard off.</p>

<p>This is the plain short truth: and the
reader by this time may ghess what a fine
life we had of it, under the arbitrary direction
of a captain, who had neither principles
to act honestly, nor conscience to
speak truth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>At the close of this tale he endeavours
to be witty, by saying that the men refused
to carry me to the boat; for that they would
not load themselves with the weight of one
who was neither seaman nor soldier. Whether
they said so, or no, I shall not inquire,
for wit and truth may be as far distant as
the poles. It’s the only place in all his
book where he aims to be witty, and the
singularity of it makes me take this notice
of it: though I can see no reason for his
giving it that turn here; because bringing
a boat off shore could not require a man to
be much of a soldier or sailor: but if he
means want of courage or conduct, I allow
he has always been witty enough not to
tell me so since we came home.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> flushed with his imaginary success
at this island of <i>Chiloe</i>, now affects
the Statesman; and offers to the public a
scheme of the advantages which might accrue
to <i>Great Britain</i>, by taking that island,
p. 113, 114; with hopes, no doubt, of being
at the head of such an undertaking:
but one may easily foresee, without prejudging
the man, that he who has behaved
so ill in this expedition, will never be trusted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
with any command in another: and ’tis
well enough known, without his medling,
that no people can make settlements in
the <i>Spanish West-Indies</i>, with so much ease
and safety, as the <i>English</i> if they please; as
having skill and power to do anything at
sea, if they have good commanders.</p>

<p>But it must appear very absurd to the government,
to whom he submits this notion
of his, that a mariner who has circumnavigated
the globe, can discover no better
place than <i>Chiloe</i> for his <i>Britannic</i> Majesty’s
subjects to possess themselves of; from the
great dangers of which he owns all of us
to be but providentially escaped: for according
to his own, and my description of
it (who have been very particular) it appears
immediate destruction for any one to attempt
the going in. He owns he lost his
anchor at his first coming too; and gives
a most terrible account of the chanel, himself:
and yet has the folly and presumption
to incourage his own countrymen to settle
here. What can this be, but a design against
the lives of his Majesty’s good subjects?
In my humble opinion ’tis malice
prepense, and deserves exemplary punishment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>And as for the additional stock of provision
he boasts of, p. 100, he has much
magnified it in his book: and whatever it
might be, it was not worth our going there
to alarm the coast, and thereby frustrate the
very design of our coming out. A stranger
would rather believe he had been bribed
before he left <i>London</i>, by this counter method
to defeat the whole enterprize.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Clipperton</i> by this time might reasonably
be supposed gone from <i>Fernandes</i>:
so away we sail from <i>Chiloe</i> to our own satisfaction,
as well as the great joy of the
King of <i>Spain</i>’s subjects, whom we had
plagued all round that bay, tho’ to little
purpose.</p>

<p>But instead of <i>Fernandes</i>, he is quickly
furnished with another excuse from holding
his course thither; which he says, p.
115, was the persuasions of his people to
the contrary: “for they had notions, which
the <i>Frenchman</i> had inspired them with, of
vast advantages by going first to the port
of <i>Conception</i>.” This too is all a fiction,
forged at home to palliate his own male
practice; for we were all against medling
with the continent, and wanted to seek
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
out our consort and try our fortune at sea;
which ’tis well known has always been, and
must be the practice of privatiers, who
mean to succede in their undertaking.</p>

<p>But if any doubt had arisen, why did
he not, in this emergence, call a council
of his officers according to his own instructions,
which obliged him particularly to
follow that method observed by captain <i>Rogers</i>,
printed at large in his voyage, and
where there are examples enough of this
kind? But <i>Shelvocke</i>’s reason for not doing
it now, and for never once doing it at all, is
a manifest proof that the faults he imputes
to his officers, are forgeries of his own,
made to excuse his vices at the expense of
their credit.</p>

<p>However, <i>Shelvocke</i> goes into <i>Conception</i>,
where he took two ships; the one waiting
for her loading, and worth little; the other
was worth to us about 1500<i>l</i>: one moiety of
which was laid aside for the owners; but
when he lost his ship, they divided that and
all among them, as he says, p. 227; tho’
he has thought fit not to mention any thing
of his own six shares. Here he stays
about a fortnight, under pretense of receiving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
ransom for the two ships; tho’ he knew
very well that the governers in those parts
never will, or dare suffer that practice, since
thereby privatiers might make a tolerable
hand on’t, tho’ even the whole coast were
alarm’d: for it’s not only loss of ship and
cargo to the ransomer, but likewise confiscation
of all his goods and chattels: and what
is yet to them more dreadful, the anathema
or curses of the church.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the governer of <i>Conception</i>
desires he may treat with one of our captain’s
officers: so I was order’d on that important
negotiation; but all my intreaties
could not prevail with <i>Shelvocke</i> to let my
servant go in his hat: he must wear one of
the foremention’d tall grenadier caps two
foot high. The fellow being of a squat size
looked more like a burlesk figure in a droll,
than a servant to an ambassador. So I proceeded,
and was attended to the governer by
all the mob in the town, and had much
ado to look grave at so much farce. <i>Shelvocke</i>
says, p. 142, “the man’s cap gave
great offense, as if intended to ridicule
the mitre:” which I can’t deny; for the
churchmen had good reason to take umbrage
at the extreme height of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>P. 123. He has a falsity too flagrant to
be believed at all. “I could perceive, says
he, with my perspective an enemies boat
pass within pistol shot of my pinnace,
but captain <i>Hatley</i>, who commanded,
never offered once to follow her, or
bring her to: <i>Hatley</i> truly said he did
not mind her, tho’ his boat’s crew all agreed
that she was full of men:” This he
exults upon mighty captain-like; but I affirm
that <i>Hatley</i> did chace her immediately,
and we were all well enough diverted with
it; he following her quite cross the bay
till he came within reach of the enemies
guns on the platform; from whence they
fired twice at him, and so well aimed, that
in all probability the third would have sunk
him, or made him the head shorter, the
shot being eighteen pounders. This I am
sure was in the sight of ten thousand people
round the bay; for all that part of
<i>Chili</i> was alarm’d, and whosoever was fit
to bear arms appeared here to see the issue
of our exploits.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> having taken here, just after
coming into the port, a small prize bound
from <i>Lima</i>, found by letters she brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
from the merchants there, that the coast was
alarm’d to norward by one of <i>Clipperton</i>’s
prizes retaken by the <i>Spaniards</i>: but this he
keeps a secret from us, and resolves now to
get rid of his men as fast as he can; therefore
sends away lieutenant <i>Randal</i>, and an
officer of marines, with about twenty five
men, in a small bark which we took in the
bay, to attack a little vessel that was hawl’d
up almost dry, in a creek about six or seven
miles from us: <i>Shelvocke</i> must needs have
known that there could be nothing in her,
since it was no secret to the <i>Spaniards</i> that
we were an <i>English</i> privatier. The vanity
of this attempt wants no explanation of
mine, since he hath sufficiently described
the folly and misfortune of it himself, p.
125. which is worth reading: there he lost
five of his men, risquing their lives to take
an empty, vessel: and the only incouragement
he had of success from this undertaking,
was from the boatswain of a small
<i>Spanish</i> prize which he took a day or two
before, who was already grown so very sincere
a friend, and so heartily in our interest
as to give us prodigious informations: and
upon the credit of this man, <i>Shelvocke</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
pretends he sent the poor fellows to make
this new experiment; which I may venture
to say has proved our captain to be no politician.</p>

<p>After this he tells you, p. 127, the men
murmur’d and grew very uneasy, damning
the <i>South Seas</i>&mdash;&mdash;as well they might, being
thus order’d upon fools errands, without
any hopes of making a good voyage for
themselves; destined as it were for mere
tools to carry on his own selfish ignorant
projects. And yet <i>Shelvocke</i>, with a bold
face and harden’d heart, says, even this too
was their own fault. In short his conscience
is an original; his book is an original,
and he is an original; but I hope in God
neither of ’em will ever be copied.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Clipperton</i> persued his voyage directly
from the <i>Cape Verd</i> islands, and I do
think it somewhat extraordinary, and well
deserving the reader’s remark, that the <i>Success</i>
arrived at the entrance into the streights
of <i>Magellan</i> on the 30th of <i>May</i> 1719, being
52 and 30 south latitude. But <i>Shelvocke</i>
could not find his way to St. <i>Catherine</i>’s, in
latitude 27 : 30 south, till the 20th of <i>June</i>
following, by his own account, p. 17.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>I shall transcribe captain <i>Clipperton</i>’s procedings
as minuted down in Mr. <i>Taylor</i>’s
journal.</p>

<p><i>Success, May 29.</i> “This day at noon I
make my course from the westermost
point of the island <i>Fogo</i>, one of the
<i>Cape Verd</i> islands, latitude 14 : 40 N.
to <i>Cape Virgin Mary</i>, the north point of
the entrance into the freights of <i>Magellan</i>,
in latitude 52 : 15 S. to be S. 29 : 00
W. the distance 1580 leagues, mer. dist.
36 : 04 W. longitude 44 : 18 W.”</p>

<p><i>May</i> the 30th. “Fresh gales and squally
for the first part these twenty four hours,
but fairer towards the latter end. This
afternoon we anchored in the streights of
<i>Magellan</i>, in ten fathom water. The
south point of the entrance call’d <i>Queen
Catharine’s Foreland</i>, bearing then S.S.W.
five leagues, and <i>Cape Virgin Mary</i> N. by
E. one league. It makes like a large deep
bay. We weigh from hence the next
day, proceding farther till we come to
<i>Queen Elizabeth</i>’s islands; where we send
our pinnace ashore on the main, having
found a fresh water river, but frozen up.
We saw several flocks of geese and ducks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
but were very shy. Our surgeon’s mate
remains on shore. One <i>Robert Dawson</i>,
a saylor, departed this life. Our surgeon’s
mate was brought on board in the
morning almost dead with the cold. At
ten in the morning we weighed and made
sail.”</p>

<p><i>June</i> the 7th. “Fresh gales and fair weather
the first part, but the later much
snow. At two this afternoon anchor’d in
forty fathom water, the northmost point
of <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Island bore S. W. one
league, St. <i>Bartholomew</i>’s island E. by S.
two leagues: the yawl was sent ashore
to gather greens. This place affords great
quantity of a sort of wild sellary, which
very much refreshed our men, and is good
salading enough.”</p>

<p><i>June</i> the 13th. “These twenty four
hours squally with snow. We find here
a good watering-place. Here is a fine
wood, most hazel, with some tall beach
trees, several of which are fit for masts.”</p>

<p>---- 14. “Sent our launch ashore with
our empty casks: captain <i>Clipperton</i> and
the carpenter went this morning ashore
to look for a good stick for a mizen-mast,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
and find a good one ready fell’d. At noon
the captain return’d with some wildfoul.
Our men gather muscles and limpets in
great plenty. Here we begin sorely to
feel the want of our wine and brandy:
and our men by frequent eating shellfish
to help out with their allowance, are
much troubled with the scurvy.”</p>

<p>20. “Cloudy weather, with much sleet
and rain. Our launch brought on board
her loading of wood, which we stowed
away among the cask: at five this morning
clear’d the hause and brought the
small-bower on board: hoisted the launch
in; at eleven our pinnace brought on
board a mizen and mizen-top-sail-yard,
with a new studdinsail-boom, and got
ready to sail.”</p>

<p>21. “Weighed this forenoon at eleven.
The tide being spent, stood into a small
bay, but could find no ground with seventy
fathom line; so were obliged to
run to leeward again. Winds from S. W.
to N. W.”</p>

<p>22. “Fresh gales and squally: at one
this afternoon anchored in a fine bay in
fifteen fathom, shingly ground: the northmost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
point of <i>Port Famine</i> N. by W. five
leagues, and the southmost point of the
small bay, which we christen’d <i>no Bottom
Bay</i>, S. by E. four mile. At seven we
weighed again plying to the southward;
we had this day a good amplitude, and
find the variation to be 14° : 15´ northerly.
All the trees along shore are very tall;
their tops cover’d with snow; the land
prodigious high, so that we have strong
flaws of wind almost continually: fresh
water to be found in every bay.”</p>

<p>29. “A canoe with four <i>Indians</i> came
on board us, being two men a woman
and a boy: they are of a middle stature, dark
complexion, a broad roundvisage, low fore-heads,
black hair, very lank and short,
with no cloathing but a skin to cover the
middle: they had a small streak round the
skin of their wrists, of a fine azure blue:
they would not suffer the woman to
come on board: captain <i>Clipperton</i> ordered
them some bread and cheese, which
they eat greedily, but would not touch
a drop of brandy. They brought us
some wild geese and ducks, which they
exchanged for knives: they had a fire in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the midship of their canoe, which is
made of the bark of trees sewed together.
They had bows and arrows, and some
fishing tackle. After two hours stay they
went ashore, making signs they would
come again. To day we buried <i>Thomas
Camfield</i> a marine.”</p>

<p>30. “Cloudy weather: our pinnace went
ashore this afternoon at one, and returned
at six, and with them the <i>Indian</i> canoe
loaden with large muscles, which they
truck’d with our people for bread, and
what else they could get.”</p>

<p><i>July 1.</i> “Moderate weather: our pinnace
was sent ashore to fetch one of
our men that tarried there yesterday, but
could not find him. Our surgeon’s mate
had one of his toes cut off, mortified with
cold that night he stay’d ashore. At
seven forenoon loosed both topsails; at
nine weigh’d, and our pinnace brought the
man aboard: an <i>Indian</i> canoe came on
board; and one of them steping in, and
being under fresh way, the rest of his
companions held fast the towline, till
they were almost hawl’d under water:
so they were forced to let go the rope,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
and the <i>Indian</i> remain’d on board. <i>Cape
Froward</i> bore at noon E. 14 mile; <i>Point
Gallant</i> N. E. by E. four mile.”</p>

<p>2. “Moderate weather at half an hour
past four this afternoon anchored in twenty
fathom, small sand and shells. The
body of <i>Prince Rupert</i>’s island bore south
three mile: the low point of the bay
we were in N. W. one mile. Another
<i>Indian</i> canoe came on board: the woman
they had wore a necklace of small
beautiful shels, nicely strung, which went
five or six turns round her neck; it look’d,
at a small distance, like a pearl one. At
seven this morning weigh’d and try’d the
strength of the current, which ran about
two knots.”</p>

<p>3. “For these twenty four hours strong
gales of wind and cloudy weather: this
afternoon at one anchor’d in thirty one
fathom; small stones and shells. Point
<i>Middleton</i> W. by S. two leagues, and
the point of St. <i>Jerom</i>’s found N. W.
by W. four mile: the tide run two knots
and a half. At five in the afternoon, being
high water, sounded in twenty seven
fathom, at ten, forty five fathom, at twelve,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
forty five fathom, the ship having
tail’d out. At four in the morning we
found she drove: brought the cable
to the capston and hove; but the tide
running strong to leeward, and a fresh
gale, she drove very fast: so that half past
five we were forced to cut away the
anchor with half the cable: and before
we could get our sails set we were just
aboard <i>Prince Rupert</i>’s island, having fifty
fathom close to the side of it: but our
sails filling, we had the good fortune to
run off; and were forced quite back
to <i>Point Gallant</i> bay, where we anchor’d
in fourteen fathom.”</p>

<p>5. “These twenty four hours strong
gusts of wind, with much snow and rain.
At night dy’d Mr. <i>John Crawford</i>: several
more fall ill: captain <i>Shelvocke</i> has many
curses: at six forenoon our pinnace was
sent ashore to get greens and other refreshments
for the sick men. Winds at
W. and N. W.”</p>

<p>7. “These twenty four hours strong squalls
of winds: lowered our fore and main
yards, at three this afternoon moor’d the
ship. Mr. <i>William Pridham</i> our master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
gunner departed this life: buried one
<i>Thomas Oldfield</i>.”</p>

<p>8. “These twenty four hours pretty moderate
weather: at four this afternoon
got up our lower yards: at eleven this
morning we buried our gunner ashore,
under a triple discharge of our small
arms: and had an end of a strong plank
drove down at the head of his grave, inscribed
with his name, the ship’s name,
with the month and year.”</p>

<p>10. “Squally weather with snow. At
two this morning lower’d our yards again:
at five <i>Francis Doyle</i>, one of our marines,
died. The pinnace kept constantly imploy’d
in fetching muscles and other
shellfish: and the wild sellery, already
mentioned, being the only eatable we can
yet discover.”</p>

<p>11. “Moderate gales and hazy weather,
with snow. At three this afternoon
clear’d the hause: at seven this morning
got up the yards again; this day put our
ships company to shorter allowance of
six to two, <i>i. e.</i> one piece of beef or
pork for six men.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>17. “At eight in the forenoon weighed
again, and at noon anchor’d in <i>York Road</i>,
which is the same place we were drove
out from when we lost our anchor; it
is gravelly ground: <i>Point Middleton</i> W.
S. W. three leagues, <i>Cape Quad</i> W. by
S. five leagues.”</p>

<p>18. “Hazey weather with rain and snow.
At half an hour past nine this evening the
ship drove, it being loose sandy ground;
hove up the anchor and stood into the
bay. At eleven anchor’d in eight fathom:
our buoy being staved, weighed
the best bower to bend another, and so
let it drop again. Moor’d: winds at
W. N. W.”</p>

<p>20. “This morning captain <i>Mitchel</i> and
lieutenant <i>Davison</i> went in the pinnace
to <i>Terra del Fuego</i> or the south shore, in
order to make a discovery of the passage
that the <i>French Tartan</i> is said to have
went thro’ into the <i>South-Sea, May 1713</i>,
and to see if there was any anchoring
beyond <i>Cape Quad</i>; being furnish’d with
all necessaries for that purpose.”</p>

<p>29. “The pinnace return’d, having found
the passage thro’ which the <i>Tartan</i> pass’d,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
but so narrow, that it was judged hazardous
to go far that way: but their provisions
fell short, and that place affording
no manner of supply, they were forced
to return before they could satisfy themselves
throughly: yet they found several
good bays to the N. W. of <i>Cape Quad</i>
to anchor in. The <i>Indians</i> gave them
a seal, which they broyled and roasted,
and said it eat as well as any venison.”</p>

<p><i>August 1.</i> “Captain <i>Mitchel</i>, with three
more of our officers took the pinnace at
six this forenoon, and resolve this time
to inform themselves of the truth concerning
the passage already mentioned into
the <i>South-Sea</i>, and see if ’twere practicable
for us to go through. Our other
boats go a wooding and watering. This
morning died <i>Thomas Parry</i> corporal of
marines.”</p>

<p>5. “Captain <i>Mitchel</i> returns: but found
no such passage to go thro’ into the
<i>South-Sea</i>, as Monsieur <i>Frezier</i> would
make us believe. It’s true they found a
narrow streight which led them into a
spacious bay full of ice: but no passage
through.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>I shall transcribe no more from <i>Taylor</i>’s
journal of what happen’d to them in these
streights: what I have taken is for the information
of my seafaring reader, and to shew
him the many fatigues that <i>Clipperton</i>’s men
were harrassed with in mooring and unmooring;
their struggling with contrary
winds and currents; the loss of their anchor,
and their narrowly escaping a shipwreck
against <i>Rupert</i>’s island: all which
will easily convince him that to go through
<i>le Mair</i> streights and round <i>Cape Horne</i>, is
the safest and shortest navigation: Besides,
the <i>French</i>, who have carried on a constant
trade to those seas for almost thirty years,
have always chosen it: add to this that
captain <i>Clipperton</i>’s endeavours to find out
the passage through <i>Terra del Fuego</i>, talked
of by <i>Frezier</i>, demonstrate that he would
gladly have been out of the streights as
soon as he could: but <i>Mitchel</i>, who was a
good seaman and curious enough, having
made two essays, which took him up a fortnight,
returned without finding any new
passage: so that it’s very doubtful whether
any <i>Tartan</i>, or other imbarkation ever past
that way; tho’ <i>Frezier</i> has fondly imagined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
it a new discovery, and has marked it in
his chart, which also is faulty in other respects.</p>

<p><i>August 18.</i> Captain <i>Clipperton</i> got out
of the streights of <i>Magellan</i>, proceding directly
towards <i>Fernandes</i>, lat. 33 : 30 S.
being the third and last place of rendezvous,
where he arrives on the 7th of <i>September
1719</i>. According to his instructions
he stays here a month for <i>Shelvocke</i>, and
if he had stay’d four, he must then have gone
without him. Captain <i>Clipperton</i> not being
able to conjecture what was become of
the <i>Speedwel</i>, gives her up for lost: however,
before he weighed he sent captain
<i>Mitchel</i> ashore to set up a cross, burying
at the foot thereof a bottle, wherein was
a letter for captain <i>Shelvocke</i>, directing
another place of rendezvous and some proper
signals to know each other at sea: but
fearing that two of his men who had there
deserted and absconded in the woods, might
mischievously take down the said cross; he
had his own name and <i>Magee</i>’s the surgeon,
carv’d in the bark of one of the largest
trees first presenting it self at landing.</p>

<p><i>Taylor</i>’s Journal <i>Sept. 8. 1719</i>. “This
being the last place of rendezvous to meet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
with or hear of the <i>Speedwel</i>: we find
no signal nor footsteps of her; which
gives us all no small uneasiness.”</p>

<p>---- 9. “At eight this morning sent
sixteen men ashore: three of them die
soon after they land, cursing <i>Shelvocke</i>
with their dying breath, for running away
with our wine and brandy. The truth
of it is, our case is deplorable enough;
for we have not a drop of either to chear
the languishing spirits of our sick men:
and we that at present, through the providence
of the Almighty, injoy our health,
cannot help being dejected to think how
soon it may come to our turns to be
taken with sickness.”</p>

<p>14. “Uncertain weather with rain. This
day our boats bring eighteen goats aboard:
sent ashore for some salt; our men having
found here a good quantity ready
made, which was left by some of the
<i>French</i> ships who often touch here.”</p>

<p>28. “We continue to get our wood
and water aboard, and our ship in a posture
for sailing.”</p>

<p><i>Oct. 6.</i> “Moderate gales of wind and
fine weather. Captain <i>Mitchel</i> with some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
more of our officers go in the pinnace
to the east part of the island to look four
of our men, who have absented a fortnight:
two of which men they found in
the custody of our goat hunters, having met
with them when in persuit of their game,
saying they had greater difficulty in securing
these fellows, than in killing double
the number of goats: for at first they
were forced to fire several times at them
before they would surrender. They told
our men that for the first five days they
were hard put to’t, being forced to subsist
wholly on the cabbage-trees, of which
here is great plenty; but that having by
good fortune one night found some fire
that was left by our hunters, it served
them in good stead, for they could then
dress their fish and fill their bellies. Our
pinnace is sent ashore to launch the longboat.
Salted more fish, and brought off
four cask more of seal.”</p>

<p>7. “Got all our people off the island into
the launch, with most of the things we
had on shore; leaving the two men that
run away to take possession of <i>Alexander
Selkirk</i>’s habitation, who was taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
off this desolate place by captain <i>Rogers</i> in
1709; after having liv’d here above four
years alone. Captain <i>Mitchel</i> goes ashore
to set up a cross with a bottle buried
at the foot of it, wherein is a letter
for captain <i>Shelvocke</i>. At five this morning
unmoord, and at eight weighed.”</p>

<p>The names carved as aforesaid on the
bark of the tree stood thus, as I saw them.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Captain <i>John &mdash;&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>W. Magee.</i></p>
<p class="i2">1719.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The reason why <i>Clipperton</i>’s surname is
omitted, was because he was well known
in the <i>South-Seas</i>: and if any <i>Spaniards</i>
or <i>French</i> who occasionally touch there had
seen it, the discovery of the name might
probably have alarmd the coast of <i>Chili</i> and
<i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p>This done, captain <i>Clipperton</i> holds his
course to the norward, soon arriving in
the parallel of <i>Lima</i>: which being the chief
scene of action, he stands off and on at a
convenient distance, to prevent being descryed
from the shore; where he had cruised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
but a small time, before he made himself
master of several prizes: but necessity obliging
him to send at least two officers, besides
a sufficient number of his men on board
each prize, it weaken’d him very much, so
that he soon grasped more than he could
hold. Add to this the low condition of his
men, both by sickness and a reduction of
their allowance that they were not overable
to work the ship; besides the loss of thirty
men, who dyed between the equator and this
place. The misfortune of all this will best
be seen in what follows: for in <i>November</i>
the <i>Success</i> giving chase to a fresh sail a head,
the last taken prize was run away with by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, who by stratagem got the
better of the few <i>English</i> that were put
aboard her in a hurry: while the enemy,
with manifest risque of their own lives, ran
their ship ashore among the rocks, and alarmd
all the coast.</p>

<p>&mdash;Here follow <i>Taylor</i>’s own words.</p>

<p><i>Success</i>, <i>November</i> the 20th. “Fresh gales
and fair weather. Yesterday at three in the
afternoon we were surprized to see that
when we made the signal to tack and
stand off from the land, our last taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
prize instead of observing the same, made
sail for the shore as fast as she could,
she being then the sternmost and nearest
the shore, while we stand off, having another
sail in view.”</p>

<p>21. “Little winds and fair weather. At
three this afternoon finding the pink that
yesterday stood in for the shore was run
away with by the <i>Spaniards</i>, we begin to
think it now full time to send all the
<i>Spanish</i> prisoners ashore, as well to save
our provision, as to let the <i>Spaniards</i> ashore
have early notice of our good treatment
towards those we had taken; that
our men may be used after the same
manner.”</p>

<p>From this period, therefore, I date the
breaking of our scheme, and the ruin of our
voyage; of both which captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
was intirely the author. This I need not
labour to prove, because it’s manifest if
<i>Shelvocke</i> had joyned <i>Clipperton</i>, and been
here at his duty, the loss of this prize had
not happened; or which is infinitely worse,
the alarming of the <i>Spaniards</i>: upon whose
security the greatest hope of our enterprize
was founded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>From this misfortune of <i>Clipperton</i> on
the coast of <i>Peru</i>, and the wilful mismanagement
of <i>Shelvocke</i> in rousing all the
coast of <i>Chili</i>, a stop was put to the success
of both our ships, and the consequence was
an imbargo laid by the Viceroy of <i>Peru</i>,
which was enough to check all our growing
wishes and expectations. Here then we
must a while leave captain <i>Clipperton</i>, who
could do nothing effectually without the
assistance of our ship, which he now thought
had quite deserted him, or was cast away:
and if the <i>Speedwel</i> had joyned him, his
prizes could not have grown so numerous:
for ’twas designed, that one of the ships
should carry the captures to the desert islands
to leeward, where the prisoners might have
subsisted on their own provisions; we sinking
the first taken ships, to leave them no
opportunity of alarming the coast, ’till the
work were done, and our fortunes made.
According to <i>Clipperton</i>’s own scheme, who
projected and commanded this voyage, our
greatest dependance was in this parallel:
<i>Lima</i> being the grand mart of all trade and
business carryed on from <i>North</i> to <i>South</i> on
this vastly extended rich continent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Here I think it worth observing that captain
<i>Clipperton</i> can no way deserve censure
in his conduct, having hitherto, tho’ under
a hard lot, acted justly and prudently: but
what can be the merits of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>,
who after providentially escaping the violent
tempest at first setting out, makes his own
ill use of it, and would never again endeavour
to meet his consort; but shun’d it
with all the craft imaginable? What recompense
can <i>Shelvocke</i> make for the indecent
censures and cruel reflexions thrown upon
the memory of the dead? Certainly <i>Clipperton</i>
deserved better from a man to whose
wilful mismanagement all his misfortunes
are justly imputed: and ’tis no wonder, if
he took to drinking, after having miscarryed
in three voyages to the <i>South-Seas</i>: the two
first by circumvention of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
this last by the treachery of one who should
have been his consort and friend: ’tis what
we see daily in people undone by the baseness
of men and the frowns of fortune.
As to the humanity of our two commanders,
there is certainly this difference between
them; <i>Shelvocke</i> took care on all
occasions, to risque the lives of his men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
that few might remain witnesses of his falshood,
and the dividends of those who did
survive might rise in greater proportion:
for out of his 106 men carryed from <i>Plymouth</i>,
he brought only 25 to <i>China</i>; whereas
<i>Clipperton</i> brought most of his thither;
and behaved with generosity and good temper,
witness his concern for his men, who
were run away with in the prize lately mentioned,
and his good treatment of the enemy;
since he did not care how soon the <i>Spaniards</i>
went ashore to give what account they
thought fit of him.</p>

<p>The contrivance by which the <i>Spaniards</i>
got their ship again, was thus. The <i>Spanish</i>
captain seeing by the number of prizes then
in the custody of captain <i>Clipperton</i> that he
could not spare many of his hands to put
aboard the pink, which already had above
a dozen passengers, besides the ship’s company:
the master of the <i>Rosary</i> privately
bid the passengers hide themselves in the
hold with the countermaster or boatswain
who was a <i>Frenchman</i>, ordering them upon
a signal agreed on, to seize as many of the
<i>Englishmen</i>, as should happen to go into the
hold; and this plot they believed would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
succede as the lieutenant drew nearer and
nearer to board them; for <i>Serjeantson</i> had
but seven or eight men with him. The
lieutenant upon his boarding the prize, ordered
all that appeared to him, such as <i>Indians</i>,
<i>Nigros</i> and seamen to go into the
great cabin, except the captain and pilot,
and then placed a centinel at the door.
When he thought he had effectually secur’d
his prisoners, he gave orders to hoist the
topsails and stand for the commodore: then
apprehending no danger, the men heedlesly
went down to see what there was aboard.
The passengers who were secretly in the hold
surprized the men, knocking some of them
down with billets of wood: the prisoners
in the cabin immediately rushed on the centinel
and disarmed him. The master or pilot,
according to the sign, coming at the
same time behind <i>Serjeantson</i> knocked him
down likewise, and ordered them all to be
bound; tho’ none were killed as <i>Serjeantson</i>
informed me, whom I afterwards found
a prisoner at <i>Lima</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Spaniard</i> thus regain’d the possession
of his ship; but did not long injoy her; for
eagerly running her ashore, he lost her on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the rocks, and narrowly escaped with his
life: then setting the <i>Englishmen</i> free from
their bonds, they all got ashore as well as
they could, the <i>Spaniards</i> taking them prisoners
the nearest way to <i>Lima</i>.</p>

<p>The viceroy of <i>Peru</i> understanding what
the <i>Spanish</i> captain had done, order’d a new
ship to be built for him at <i>Guiaquil</i>, and a
general tax among the traders to pay the
value of her, as a reward for the service he
had done the public. One of <i>Clipperton</i>’s
men upon examination declared all he knew
of our designs in this voyage: and upon
these occasions, there is seldom one wanting
who will tell any thing to merit what
favour he can. Among other discoveries,
the viceroy is informed of the cross and
bottle at <i>Fernandes</i>, with the written signals
for captain <i>Shelvocke</i>, and that two of
<i>Clipperton</i>’s men had deserted there: upon
which he immediately sends out a small
vessel to fetch the two men, and the bottle
containing the signals.</p>

<p>We return now to <i>Shelvocke</i> whom we
left in the bay of <i>Conception</i> treating with
the governer about the ransom of the two
ships: but our captain finding he was only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
trifled with, thought fit to burn the two
ships there in the harbour: upon which I
shall only observe, that it was a very extravagant
humour: for one of the ships, the
St. <i>Fermin</i>, he owns <i>p.</i> 153, was the best
fitted out of any of the <i>Peruvian</i> traders,
and <i>p.</i> 104, he says the loss of his anchor
at <i>Chiloe</i> was one of the greatest damages
he could have sustained: therefore ’tis much
that a man of his pretended knowledge
could not save an anchor and cable to supply
the former loss of his own: the neglect
of which appeared sufficiently afterwards.</p>

<p>After he had set fire to the ships, he took
along with him the fruit bark, upon which
he orders a deck to be made, calling her
the <i>Mercury</i>: (an odd name for a vessel that
could neither sail nor row) and away we
procede towards <i>John Fernandes</i>.</p>

<p>In our way thither, the prize and plunder
money of the St. <i>Fermin</i> was distributed;
and here he says <i>p.</i> 157, that captain <i>Betagh</i>
indeavours to raise a mutiny but fails
in the attempt. Particularly, that I opposed
the owners having part of any thing but
what was upon freight or mention’d in
the bills of lading; and thus he runs off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
two pages of mere scandal, as if I only was
uneasy, whereas all our officers had convincing
proofs of his bad principles as well
as I. I might have said in common talk among
our selves, that I always thought wearing
apparel found in chests between decks,
should be deemed fair plunder: and may be
it is so. Is it just therefore, that what a
man delivers as private opinion only, shall
afterwards be reap’d up and call’d mutiny;
especially by one who has made every thing
plunder, and ruin’d and destroy’d near a hundred
men in the voyage? But this man is
perpetually blaming every body but himself
to screen his own villanies.</p>

<p><i>Jan</i>. 17<sup>19</sup>/<sub>20</sub>. We arrive at <i>Fernandes</i>, where
Mr. <i>Brook</i> being the first officer that landed,
immediately saw Captain <i>John</i> &mdash;&mdash; and <i>W.
Magee</i> cut in the tree-bark as aforesaid: upon
the news of which every body seemed to rejoyce,
but our worthy captain, who would
have it an invention of <i>Brook</i>’s, for which
he used him scurvily before all the company,
telling him ’twas a lie. It’s very strange
a man can’t believe his own eyes, or would
feign a thing of this nature, which any one
going ashore might be convinced of in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
moment: but <i>Shelvocke</i> hated the mention
of it, and feared the truth of it, lest his
whole company would be impatient, and
persuade him without delay to go to leeward
and joyn his consort. <i>Brook</i> had hitherto
been a great favourite with <i>Shelvocke</i>,
but for this unwelcome discovery he is now
put upon the black list, as by the sequel
will appear.</p>

<p>I shall quote our author’s own words,
<i>p.</i> 160. “Some of my men accidentally
saw the word <i>Magee</i>, which was the
name of <i>Clipperton</i>’s surgeon, and captain
<i>John</i> cut out under it upon a tree, but
no directions left, as was agreed on by
him in his instructions to me. His actions
being thus grosly repugnant to his instructions,
it was evident that he never
meant I should keep him company, or
ever joyn with him again.”</p>

<p>Now this is so notorious a falsehood, that
every step of captain <i>Clipperton</i> shews the
contrary, and proves you the greatest impostor
that can be: your very wording of
it, shews to what mean shifts you are reduced.
Why must it be, <i>accidentally</i> saw the
word <i>Magee</i>? Was it a meteor that vanished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
after the first appearance? or if the men did
see it by chance, are you so simple to persuade
us it was cut in the tree by chance?
And then to say <i>Magee</i> was first, and the
captains name under it, is not the contrary
more probable? Besides, we all saw the
captain’s name first: and this is only a stupid
indeavour to degrade him. As for the
directions agreed upon, they were buryed
in the ground, and discovered to the viceroy
who sent for them as I said before; and tho’
<i>Shelvocke</i> was ignorant of this at <i>Fernandes</i>;
yet, at the writing of his book, he well
knew it: and therefore the coarse language
he gives <i>Clipperton</i> as above, makes himself
appear a worse wretch than I expected.</p>

<p>After this, instead of going directly to
leeward to meet with the <i>Success</i>, he must
needs have another touch with the shore;
and accordingly steers away to <i>Arica</i>, sending
the <i>Mercury</i> along shore before him,
which took a bark laden with cormorants
dung (used there as manure) the owner
of which came on board us in the night,
and informed us that one of <i>Clipperton</i>’s
prizes had alarmed the whole coast, and that
two <i>Spanish</i> men of war were fitted out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
from <i>Lima</i> in quest of us: and this is what
we believed <i>Shelvocke</i> knew before, by letters
taken in the St. <i>Fermin</i>. Here he puts
four quarter deck guns into the <i>Mercury</i>, and
hawling her pretty near the shore, gets into
her, with my self, Mr. <i>Stewart</i>, three
more officers, and a few men: then bringing
the <i>Speedwel</i> and <i>Mercury</i>’s broadside to
bear on the town, he begins <i>Quixot</i> like to
canonade it; which really had no other effect
than to scare away the women and
children: for the men contrary to our expectation
assembled on the naked beach,
and suddenly erected a good breastwork of
stones and what rubbish they could find,
gallantly standing our fire: but the swell
giving us some motion, we could not bring
our guns to bear so as to dislodge any of
them. <i>Shelvocke</i> being tired with destroying
his munition, sends an <i>Indian</i> prisoner
under a flag of truce to demand of the town
what they would please to give to be rid of
us; and tho’ he says nothing of this, <i>p.</i> 167,
the <i>Indian</i> leap’d out of the boat, swiming
through the terrible breakers, which made
landing there impossible; delivers his message,
and returns faithfully the same way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
to the boat with answer, That they car’d
not a fig for any such <i>borracho</i>; that is
drunkard, the most contemptuous name they
make use of. Upon which our captain
called for his pinnace, and taking <i>Stewart</i>
with him, goes aboard in a pet; but left
the rest of us to unmoor the <i>Mercury</i>, and
carry her out into the road. At his getting
into the boat, not as he says at his departure,
the inhabitants gave us a regular hedge
fire, and three huzzas, or horse laughs. To
confirm what I said about the strict prohibition
of ransoming; the owner of the dung
bark was forced to do it by stratagem, coming
in the night with his money, being
1300 dollars, and pray’d us to carry her three
or four mile out, and then turn her adrift,
that the bargain might be a secret, or look
as if she was not worth our keeping.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i>’s aversion to journal-keeping was
so great, that I cannot help inserting the
following memorandum to confirm it. One
Mr. <i>Hamilton</i> our ensign, a gentleman of
a good family in <i>Scotland</i>, had a mind, tho’
he was no seaman, to keep a journal for
his amusement; and upon taking this bark
he enters it thus in his book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 5th. 1720.</i> “This geud day we a
taen a sma vashel lodded wi turd.” This
humour causing some laughter in the steerage,
<i>Shelvocke</i> lent his son <i>George</i> to inquire the
meaning of that uproar. Upon <i>George</i>’s report,
the captain came down and asked <i>Hamilton</i>
what business he had to keep a journal?
adding that he was a sawcy fellow,
and there should be no pen and ink work
aboard his ship: so that he was oblig’d ever
after, like <i>Shelvocke</i>, to keep his account by
dint of memory.</p>

<p>From <i>Arica</i> we sail down along shore,
and now <i>Shelvocke</i> enters vigorously upon
his own project; which was effectually to
rid himself of his officers, having been often
heard to say, he hated so many captains.
He knew by <i>Rogers</i> his journal, that all
the merchantmen in those seas are man’d
with <i>Indians</i> or <i>Nigros</i>; with which he
could easily supply any loss of his own men;
and which, far from demanding any share
of prize money, would sell for money in
another part of the world. Whereupon
he sends away fifteen of us in the <i>Mercury</i>,
seven of which were officers, just in the
mouth of the enemy, in the very track of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
their ships; and with a moral certainty of
being taken, if not destroyed, for cruising
on their own coast, and in one of their
own bottoms. It is very remarkable that
one of this ill fated company should be the
boatswain, who is always look’d on as the
most necessary officer to be left in a ship;
the good order of the men depending as
much upon him, as the captain himself:
and a boatswain was never sent a cruising
in this world before. His name was <i>Nicholas
Laming</i>, a good man, and a good officer.
After we were taken prisoners, he
died on the road with the great fatigue of
his journey.</p>

<p>To put this man’s wickedness yet in a
dearer light, give me leave thus fairly to
describe the <i>Mercury</i>. She was really nothing
but a lighter; was built and always
imploy’d as such; tho’ not quite so heavy
or strong as those in the <i>Thames</i>: for as
the <i>Spaniards</i> have no wharves, cranes, or
carts to load their vessels with in that country;
so she differ’d from our lighters, only by
being a small matter slighter and shallower,
the better to run into shoal water; where the
<i>Nigros</i> and <i>Indians</i> do the office of cranes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and horses, by wading deep in the water to
load her. He built a deck upon her as high
as the gunnel, fix’d a mast in her, and then
put a gang of his ships oars into her: one
of which I measur’d, finding it thirty three
foot in length, and so heavy that no less
than three men could row with one of them:
beckets having been fix’d to the looms for
the easier managing of them.</p>

<p>Now I appeal to any impartial judge of
a ship or bark, how it was possible for the
men, if standing, to row with such an oar
in such a vessel: for they must at each stroke
indanger their knuckles against the deck before
the blade could be raised out of the
water: and if sitting, ’tis still worse, because
there’s no foot-hold; moreover the man at
the handle could not extend his arms to
fetch a stroke. Then if we consider her
as to her sailing, she would go well enough
right afore it, provided it blew strong enough:
but upon a wind, the meanest capacity
may imagine what she could do, as
having no gripp of the water.</p>

<p>In this notable imbarkation were we sent
to seek our fortunes; and I believe ours
to be the first company that ever was order’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
to cruise in a lighter. This being the last
time he was likely to have the pleasure of
using me ill, he resolved to do it in a manner
peculiar to himself: all the rest having
the favour of knowing their orders an hour
or two before. Immediately upon my receiving
the message, that I must go in the
<i>Mercury</i>, I went down to lash my hammack
in the <i>Speedwel</i>: then taking my
money bag out of my chest, I seal’d and
deliver’d it to Mr. <i>Hendrie</i> then our purser,
telling him I expected no account of it, till
it pleased God we met in <i>England</i>. <i>Shelvocke</i>
who had set a spy to watch my words
and looks, now calls up all hands, and ask’d
them if they thought they were going for
a sacrifice, using me in a manner too scandalous
to be recorded. After this, our commander
captain <i>Hatley</i> and the rest of us
got into the vessel and put off, steering along
shore to the <i>northward</i>. We cruised
four or five days and landed twice at the
isle of <i>Lobos</i>, where <i>Shelvocke</i> promis’d to
leave instructions, but we found none: and
if he intended we should joyn him again,
he would have told us his design of going
in to plunder the little town of <i>Payta</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
where we could easily have joyn’d him, having
the rich prize (as he calls her) twelve
days in our hands before we were all taken.
During our cruise, we took one small bark
tho’ he says two, p. 177, and that of no value:
after which we took an old <i>English</i>
pink bound from <i>Panama</i> to <i>Lima</i>, which
<i>Shelvocke</i> says at random was worth 150000
dollars, tho’ he never saw the vessel, or knew
what was in her: and I am sure we found
no money at all aboard her; for she was
bound in her ballast with a small parcel of
pedlary ware from <i>Panama</i> to <i>Lima</i>: but
were it from <i>Lima</i> to <i>Panama</i> there probably
had been money in her. We all got aboard
the prize, except a hand or two left
to take care of the <i>Mercury</i>, and kept cruising
between <i>Lobos</i> and cape <i>Blanco</i>; and
while we hop’d to be taken up by our faithful
commander <i>Shelvocke</i>, we fell into the
hands of one of the <i>Spanish</i> cruisers of 30
guns, called the <i>Brilliant</i>: which after we
struck, continu’d their fire into the <i>Mercury</i>
’till they destroyed her, tho’ the men very
providentially escaped and were made prisoners
with us. As soon as the <i>Spaniards</i>
boarded the said pink to strip and rifle us,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
about ninety six moidores taken from the
<i>Portuguese</i> off cape <i>Frio</i> were found upon
<i>Hatley</i>, for which he indeed was us’d but scurvily&mdash;And
this is the fair light I promised,
p. 30. when I was treating of this story before.</p>

<p>After leaving us, the next thing remarkable
is his long story of escaping the <i>Peregrine</i>
a <i>Spanish</i> man of war at <i>Payta</i>: which
account as it is a wild story full of abominable
romance and vain glory, I shall answer
it particularly: for <i>Hatley</i> and all of
us were sufficiently inform’d of the whole
affair, as soon as we were set ashore at
<i>Payta</i>, which was in a day or two after
this thing happen’d.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> to magnify his own exploits,
does well to magnify the force of his enemy.
He says, the <i>Peregrine</i> had upwards
of 450 men, and mounted 56 guns: I will
allow him that she carry’d 40, but never
more; for I was aboard her afterwards at
<i>Lima</i>; and I believe when he met with her,
she had 350 men aboard, but such a mixt
crew of ignorant creatures, that I am certain
twenty expert seamen would do more
execution than all they together. As for
the commander of her, whom <i>Shelvocke</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
calls an admiral, he was a <i>Creolian</i>, a mere
fresh waterman, who never saw any action
before: and as for the people aboard him,
they were composed of <i>Nigros</i>, <i>Mestizos</i>
and <i>Indians</i>; besides which there were not
above a dozen white faces in all: for this
ship was purposely design’d to carry the late
viceroy prince <i>Santo Bueno</i>, his family and
retinue to <i>Acapulco</i>; but in the mean time
order’d a short cruise on the coast. She
sail’d so heavy that the <i>Spaniards</i> never expected
she would be of any use against the
<i>English</i> privatiers: and for that reason, put
all their good able men aboard the other
three cruisers, the <i>Zelerin</i>, <i>Brilliant</i> and
<i>San Francisco</i>, which were light ships and
good sailers. The <i>Peregrine</i> was so unable
and unwilling too, that if she had not found
the <i>Speedwel</i> in harbour, she would never
have follow’d her to sea; for we were told
at <i>Payta</i>, that the first fire from the <i>Speedwel</i>
terrify’d the enemy so very much, that
they could not tell whether they were really
dead or alive. They all immediately ran
from their quarters, and the very steersman
who had the helm, quitted it: so that the
ship which was then close hawl’d standing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
in, came with her head sails in the wind,
and muzzled her self; that is, she lay bobbing
up and down, with her sails flapping
against the mast: and how could it be otherwise,
where there was only a few good
officers among a mere mob of black people
fear’d out of their wits. The commander
and his officers did what they could to
bring them to their duty: they beat them,
swore at them, and prick’d them in the
buttocks, but all would not do; for the
poor devils were resolved to be frighted:
most of them run quite down in the hold,
while others were upon their knees praying
the saints for deliverance. The <i>Speedwel</i>
did not fire above eight or nine guns;
and as they were found sufficient, <i>Shelvocke</i>
had no reason to waste his powder: but
’tis plain the <i>Peregrine</i> might easily have
run him aboard, if there had been but a
few good seamen to stand by the bowlines
and braces. However, this panic of theirs
gave <i>Shelvocke</i> a fair opportunity to get his
men aboard, cut his cable, and go away
right afore the wind. This is the plain
truth of the matter, which every body was
agreed in: for I heard of it at several places;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> has cook’d up a formal story
of a desperate ingagement to deceive those
who knew him not, into a wondrous opinion
of his conduct. He talks of his ship
being greatly shatter’d in the fight, and several
of the enemy kill’d; but ’tis all bluster:
there was not a drop of blood spilt: for if
the <i>Peregrine</i> did fire a few guns, their
confusion prevented them doing any mischief.
And <i>Shelvocke</i>’s killing some of the
enemy is very unlikely, when so many of
them run down and hid themselves.</p>

<p>’Tis impossible for words to express the
baseness of captain <i>Shelvocke</i> in puting together
so much reproachful language utterly
void of truth and reason, as there is from
p. 176 to 180. All the malice of his book
is here sum’d up in a body. He says I mutinied
about going into the <i>Mercury</i>, and
insinuates that I threaten’d his life. This is
a very poor charge of his, after contriving
so plausible a scheme to destroy us. But I
remember I answer’d these words p. 53,
when we had just doubled cape <i>Horne</i>.
As for his accusation of mutiny, ’tis as
weak as the other: for tho’ ’tis evident we
were deliver’d up as a prey, yet <i>Shelvocke</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
had gone such lengths with us, that he
would call even a wry face mutiny: and
my whole account of his transactions is full
of answer to this sort of calumny. Then
he says I prevail’d on <i>Hatley</i> to run away
with the prize, plying him with liquor for
that purpose: and runs on a long formal
story of the wickedness of this thing, when
I have made it plain she had no money, or
any thing valuable aboard. Does not <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
great ignorance in these facts demonstrate
that these false accounts in his book
were all invented here at home?</p>

<p>After this he accuses me with discovering
to the enemy the secrets of our expedition,
for which I was us’d respectfully,
and made an officer. It must be great weakness
in <i>Shelvocke</i> to fancy he had any secrets
to discover, after he had alarm’d all
the coast himself: besides the <i>Spaniards</i>
knew well enough what we came there
for; therefore ’tis childish to talk of secrets:
indeed <i>Shelvocke</i> kept his own private
designs a secret from us, which I dare
say was no intention of the voyage; and I
could not have known the places of rendezvous,
without the help of Mr. <i>Taylor</i>’s
journal. The reason of my being us’d respectfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
is this.&mdash;<i>Don Pedro Midranda</i>,
the admiral who took us, had a personal
esteem for Sir <i>Charles Wager</i>, and I have
reason to believe was formerly his prisoner.
The <i>Spanish</i> admiral had been treated with
great candour and generosity by Sir <i>Charles</i>:
and upon examination, finding that I gave
a good account of Sir <i>Charles</i>, he was
pleas’d to shew us great favours for his sake.
It was owing to this, that I and all but
captain <i>Hatley</i> met with kind treatment:
for my own part, I had the honour to eat
at his table all the time we were aboard;
where he seldom fail’d to toast Sir <i>Charles
Wager</i>, at every meal. Then it’s plain the
aforesaid guilt of <i>Hatley</i>’s made that difference
between him and the rest.</p>

<p>He says I was made an officer, and that
I desired of my new captain, if we had the
good luck to take <i>Shelvocke</i>, I might have
the honour of boarding him first.</p>

<p>After such vile procedings, by my troth
I believe no body would think it an honour
to board captain <i>Shelvocke</i>: but I deny that
I ever said so, and whatever any of us said,
he can only ghess at it. ’Tis certain we
had reason to think and speak ill enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of him; since it was evident he got rid of
us to serve a turn. However, as we were
now treated much civiler than it was in
<i>Shelvocke</i>’s nature to allow of; I frankly
own there was not a man among us, but
would gladly have seen him fall into the
same admiral’s hands: for in a very few
days after this, <i>Shelvocke</i> rids himself of
eleven more of his men, whom he sent
under <i>James Hopkins</i>, one of his mates,
aboard an empty bark not worth a groat,
which he calls the St. <i>David</i>, p. 180, leaving
them to shift for themselves, with no
more than a week’s provision: after which
they were compell’d to surrender among
the <i>Indians</i>: and one of them, <i>John Gundy</i>,
born at <i>Plymouth</i> dock, had his throat
cut for not stripping immediately: the rest
I saw prisoners with us at <i>Lima</i>. <i>Shelvocke</i>
is modestly silent upon this article, saying
only, p. 187, that he was oblig’d to leave
the St. <i>David</i> to cruise off <i>Payta</i>: but
not a word of the mate and his ten men.</p>

<p>As to my being an officer in the king of
<i>Spain</i>’s service, ’tis mere scandal and nonsense;
for if I had acted in that station in
a time of war between the two crowns,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
’tis very improbable I would venture home
so soon, being the first of the prisoners who
appear’d in <i>England</i>. Indeed we all, except
<i>Hatley</i>, had our passage to <i>Cales</i> in a <i>Spanish</i>
advice-boat, call’d the <i>Flying-fish</i>. Mr.
<i>Pressick</i> our surgeon’s mate, acted as surgeon
in her, receiving wages; and so did
all our men, being releas’d from prison to
help navigate the vessel home. For my part,
as I was well treated, I would not eat the
bread of idleness, but kept my watch as
other officers did; and pray where’s the harm
of all this; tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> and his blunderbuss
of a son, have had the stupidity to call it
treason? And it must appear a very malicious
charge, as well as an ignorant one, that
after a man has been driven amongst the
enemy, he must be call’d a traytor for being
us’d kindly and accepting his passage
back again; that because I was not murdered
there, I ought to be executed at home.
This is <i>Shelvocke</i>’s great christianity and
good conscience.</p>

<p>Lastly, he accuses me of being of a nation
and religion which the <i>Spaniards</i>
are fond of.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>In the first place, captain <i>Shelvocke</i> is
very ill bred, to make any national reflexions
at all; and then very ignorant not to know,
they are never allow’d as argument. If
he means I am an <i>Irishman</i>, I am well enough
pleased to own it: not forgeting that his
Majesty has many loyal subjects of that kingdom,
in the state, church, navy and army.
If by the other reflexion he means my religion
to be of the <i>Romish</i> church; I shall
make this answer to it. That it certainly
is the religion my parents design’d I should
be of: but when I came to riper years and
better understanding, I made use of that
liberty which God has given all mankind,
to make such confession of faith as is most
agreeable to holy scripture and right
reason.</p>

<p>Thus determin’d, I took the oaths above
twenty years ago; by which I quitted the
<i>Romish</i> faith, and abjur’d all papal authority
in these kingdoms: I did all that is requir’d in
those cases, and therefore ’tis needless to
say more. Consequent to this I had the
imployment of a purser in the navy, which
I held some years; having before that served
in several other inferiour capacities. I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
continued ever since a lawful member of
the church of <i>England</i>; What pretense then
can <i>Shelvocke</i> have to persecute me in this
unjust public manner, and charge me with
the popish religion; especially after he has
cruelly forc’d me among the most rigid professors
of it?</p>

<p>But if he means by this accusation to
make me appear as a disaffected person, I
hope he will be mistaken: for I never drank
the <i>Pretender</i>’s health, tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> made
a constant practice of it, and every tenth
of <i>June</i> proposed it in an open manner;
constraining some to do it, and using others
ill who had spirit enough to refuse it. In
what light then shall I place this <i>Shelvocke</i>,
to make his infamy truly appear? A man
who hath solemnly taken the oaths of allegiance,
abjuration and supremacy, with king
<i>George</i>’s commission in his pocket, commander
of above a hundred men, to whom
he should appear an example of goodness
and loyalty, and in a public time of war to
drink the <i>Pretender</i>’s health, and command
his men to do the same, is an instance
of such perjur’d villainy, as can never be exceded!
Considering I am a seafaring man,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
’tis for my credit that <i>Shelvocke</i> will allow
me to be of any religion: and I am really
sorry I cannot return him the complement;
but he has made such an abandon’d wretch
of himself, that I am persuaded mankind
will say ’tis better to have some religion
than none at all. For after a man has broke
thro’ oaths, which I call sacred ingagements,
and violated all moral virtues, by which
he was bound to promote the interest of us
and our owners; what idea can we have
of him? when thus he stands guilty of
treachery, cruelty, perjury, ill-nature and
ill-manners; you cannot call him a <i>christian</i>,
and he is far short of a <i>mahometan</i> both
in faith and practice.</p>

<p>Here I take leave of my noble captain
<i>Shelvocke</i>, being quite separated from him,
as he intended; and now forced to submit
to the <i>Spaniard</i>, which however prov’d the
fairer enemy of the two. Henceforth
therefore, I must trace him by the help of
<i>Taylor</i>’s journal, and the concurring evidence
of those whose hard lot it was to remain
under his command: while I go back
to captain <i>Clipperton</i>, whom I shall, in as
brief a manner as possible, bring to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
end of his voyage, which also ended his
life. He staid his month for <i>Shelvocke</i> at
<i>Fernandes</i>, as I observed before: the account
of his progress and actions after that,
I will impartially transcribe from <i>Taylor</i>’s
journal, as I find it.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">“This</span> day a paper was fixt upon
the main-mast, declaring what
should and should not be
deemed plunder.</p>

<p>“The man who first spys a sail, proving
a prize, to have five dollars for every
hundred ton the prize measures.</p>

<p>“Every man aboard a prize found drunk,
or in any indecent act with a white or
black woman, to be punished according
to the nature of his offense.</p>

<p>“Every man, of whatsoever degree, concealing
any money, or other thing above
the value of half a dollar, shall forfeit
his share of such prize, and twenty dollars
out of his share in the next that
shall be taken. The variation by an
amplitude taken this day in latitude 15
39 S. is 9″ : 20 N. E.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>25. “We this day arrive in the latitude
of <i>Lima</i>, our cruising station; where we
brought to, and lay under our topsails
till four in the morning: then made sail,
and at seven chased a small vessel, which
we came up with at eleven, being a snow
of about forty ton, laden with sand and
rubbish for manure. She was navigated
by seven <i>Indians</i> and two <i>Nigros</i>: her
master was left sick ashore. They would
not give us any intelligence. We found
nothing aboard her worth the trouble of
carrying away, except two jarrs of eggs,
two of molosses, and a couple of dollars.”</p>

<p>28.  “At one afternoon make a sail.
At two are a long-side of her, being a
ship of about 150 ton, call’d the St.
<i>Vincent</i>, with wood from <i>Guiaquil</i>. There
are two fryars, sixteen <i>Indians</i> and four
<i>Nigros</i> aboard.”</p>

<p>30.  “At four afternoon made a good
sail, which we came not up with till eleven
at night: she is a pretty large ship, of
at least 400 ton, from <i>Panama</i> for <i>Lima</i>,
having a good many passengers aboard.
She is called the <i>Trinity</i>, and
was taken by captain <i>Rogers</i> when he
plunder’d <i>Guiaquil</i>, 1709.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 2.</i>  “This afternoon at one saw a
sail: at three came up with her, being a
vessel of about seventy ton, bound from
<i>Lima</i> to <i>Panama</i>; she has on board the
countess of <i>Laguna</i>, and several other
passengers, a good deal of ready money,
and at least 400 jars of wine and brandy,
being two articles we much wanted.
Our captain asks the lady whether she
will come aboard the <i>Success</i>, or remain
in the prize. She chuses the later. He
sends a marine officer with a guard to
take care she be not molested by any
of our men, and that none enter her cabin
but her own domestics, or such as she
allows of. Mr. <i>Godfrey</i>, our agent, went
aboard the prizes, carrying to each a couple
of jars of wine and brandy, which
was a very acceptable present.”</p>

<p>18.  “At seven this morning we saw
a sail: at eleven she became our prize,
proving to be a <i>London</i> built pink of
about 200 ton from <i>Panama</i> for <i>Lima</i>,
with wood, of little value: but they
tell us of two rich ships from <i>Lima</i> coming
this way; and that there are two
<i>Spanish</i> men of war of fifty and thirty
guns, fitted out in quest of us.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>This being the prize that was run away
with by stratagem <i>Nov. 20</i>, I need not
repeat it. Turn back to p. 91 and 95.</p>

<p>24.  “This afternoon we took a prize
call’d the <i>Cayetan</i>, of about 200 tons,
laden with wood from <i>Panama</i> for <i>Lima</i>:
she has aboard forty <i>Nigros</i> and
thirty <i>Spaniards</i>, most of them passengers.”</p>

<p>27. “Anchor at the isle of <i>Plate</i> with our
three prizes. Our captain being now under
some apprehensions of the enemy’s
men of war, which we know are clean,
and fitted out on purpose to destroy or
bring us in; begins to think that his
cruising without a second, will turn but to
little account: resolves therefore to make
the most of what he has got; which consisteth
chiefly of <i>European</i> goods found in
the prizes already taken. And being
well assured the <i>Spaniards</i> dare not purchase
them by reason of a strict prohibition
from the king of <i>Spain</i>, he
puts a handsome cargo of ten thousand
pound or upwards, aboard the
lady’s bark now call’d the <i>Chichly</i>; and
appoints captain <i>Mitchel</i> commander of
her, and to dispose of them to the best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
advantage on the coast of <i>Brasil</i>. He
mounts her with eight guns, puts aboard
thirteen <i>Englishmen</i> and ten <i>Nigros</i>, with
what provision and other necessaries he
can spare him. Captain <i>Mitchel</i> at parting
gave us three cheers, which was answer’d
by the <i>Success</i>. Here our captain
discharges the other two prizes after rummaging
them of all we wanted, and gave
them to the <i>Spaniards</i>; reserving the
<i>Nigros</i>, and the captain of one of them
for our pilot. We ply to windward again
to come into our station.”</p>

<p><i>Decemb.</i> 12th. 1719. “We saw a sail about
five in the evening, and at seven took
her. She is called the <i>Rose</i>, bound from
<i>Cheripe</i> for <i>Panama</i>, laden with provisions.
Our launch and pinnace were all
day imploy’d in bringing on board the
flower, and other provisions in order to
discharge her. Having got as much flower
out of her as we could well stow away,
we cut her mainmast by the board, lest
she should overset, and so let her go.
These prisoners inform us, that our men
who were taken by the <i>Spaniards</i> were
sent to <i>Lima</i> by land. Here we continue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
to cruise, standing off all day, and
towards the shore at night: but nothing
happens till</p>

<p>27th. “Anchor in <i>Guanchaco Bay</i> in
nine fathom clay ground, and find two
ships at anchor. We fire a shot at each:
but they make no return: send our boats
aboard: but found them abandon’d, and
could discover that all the loading had just
been taken out, and nothing left aboard,
except some bread, and a few jars of water.
We hung out a flag of truce, and
fired two guns at half an hour’s interval,
hoping they would come aboard to ransom
their ships. They answer’d us from
shore; but seeing no boat coming to us,
we fired again, and remain here till next
day, when seeing it was in vain to wait
any longer, and that they would neither
ransom nor beg their ships, we pull’d
down the flag, and set the ships a fire.
At eight forenoon, the church of <i>Guanchaco</i>
bore E. 3 leagues, from whence I
take my departure, latitude 8 : 10 S. designing
for the <i>Gallipagos</i>. The currents
here set much to the northward.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p><i>January</i> 9th. 1720. “Arrive at duke
of York’s island being one of the <i>Gallipagos</i>.
Here we scrub and clean our ship,
and refresh our selves with tortoise: after
visiting some more of these islands,
we steer away to the northward.”</p>

<p>21. Made a’sail: sent our pinnace a head
to keep sight of the chase, by making
false fires: at eleven at night came up
with her, and on our firing a gun she
brought to, being a ship from <i>Panama</i>,
having on board the marquiss <i>de Villa
Roche</i> president at <i>Panama</i>, and his family
bound for <i>Lima</i>, called the <i>Prince
Eugene</i>. This is the same ship in which
captain <i>Clipperton</i> was circumvented and
taken in his late voyage in these seas,
when he received but indifferent treatment
from the said marquiss at <i>Panama</i>,
before whom he was carry’d.”</p>

<p>22. “Mr. <i>Davison</i> our first lieutenant
was sent to command the prize;
and I was order’d his assistant. At eight
in the morning the pinnace came aboard
to search for treasure: at eleven returned,
carrying the marquiss, and what else they
found most valuable. Nothing remarkable
happens till,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p><i>February</i> 26th. “We are plying to windward
in our cruising station with the last
mention’d prize. A <i>Spaniard</i> who was
accidentally wounded at the taking of
her, dying last night of his wound, his
countrymen desired he might he bury’d
after their custom and formalities; which
was granted them. When they ended
their prayers, the corpse which lay ready
on a gratin with a good bag of ballast
ty’d at the feet, was thrown over board:
but to the admiration of every one, the
body floated, and continued so till we
sailed quite from the sight of it. The
marquiss <i>de Villa Roche</i> being present
said, it was very portentous, and that
some surprizing accident must be the consequence.”</p>

<p>“Upon throwing the corpse into the
water, the <i>Spanish</i> custom is to cry aloud
<i>Bon Viaje</i> three times, that is, a good
voyage. This day took an observation
in latitude 11 : 50 N: the current here
sets very strong to windward.”</p>

<p><i>March 8.</i> “We made the island of
<i>Port Velas</i> latitude 10 : 30 N: the next
day anchor’d in thirty fathom. We find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
here a good watering place. The <i>padre</i>
and boatswain of the <i>Prince Eugene</i> come
aboard to be examined, as likewise the
marquiss to dine: the father and boatswain
being desirous to go ashore, they
have leave, on condition they will indeavour
to persuade the people to drive some
cattle to the shore, and spare what provision
they can in exchange for what we
have aboard.”</p>

<p><i>March</i> 13th. “Our launch being near
the shore, where runs a great sea, she was
hove along, soon fill’d and sunk. By
this accident we lost two men, <i>John Trumbal</i>
serjeant of marines, and <i>Roger Pengelly</i>
gunner’s mate. And here the wonderful
perfection of the <i>Nigros</i> is most
remarkable: all the rest of the men got
ashore, when one of our <i>Nigros</i> stripping
himself, takes a rope’s end, dived,
and slung the boat: after which we hawld
her up and towd her aboard, very little
damaged.”</p>

<p><i>March</i> 16th. “The <i>padre</i> and countermaster
return with some natives, bringing
four head of black cattle, some fowl,
and fruit, as a present for the marquiss;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
but told our captain, that their <i>alcalde</i>
or governer could not allow us to trade
with him. They give us an account of
captain <i>Mitchel</i>, who put in here to water,
and say that his men shot some of
their young bulls: but that 200 of the
inhabitants appearing under arms, he
thought it best to go away. We doubt
not of his being here, because we have
seen some shirts and wearables of <i>Mitchel</i>’s
men. The next day the marquiss
writes letters ashore privately, to stir up
the people to surprize our men at the watering,
and secure the boats. These with
other mischievous letters wrote to <i>Lima</i>
were stopp’d by Mr. <i>Godfrey</i> our owners
agent, who finding them in an <i>Indian</i>’s
hand ashore, sent them to captain <i>Clipperton</i>,
who now debars the marquiss the
use of pen and paper, and uses him but
roughly. The <i>Indians</i> who were yesterday
aboard, and to whom our captain made
a few presents for themselves, the church
and the governer, return this morning
with some good fresh beef. After this,
captain <i>Clipperton</i> treats with the marquiss
about ransoming the prize; but not agreeing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
he orders the timber with which she
was laden to be thrown overboard, saving
as much for firing as we could stow: after
which we rummage the cabin, taking
away all the clothes and equipage.”</p>

<p><i>March</i> 20th. “The marquiss and his
lady dine aboard the <i>Success</i>: after which
they go ashore for recreation, leaving their
only child aboard as a pledge. They send
off a good bull, and some fowl: there
being no oxen on this continent. On the
26th, the governer sends us two bulls
more; and on the 31st, the marquiss
sends a present of fruit to his child, to
bring which there are seven <i>Indians</i> a
horseback: they left two letters hanging
on a stick in the sand. Nothing happens
to the 4th of <i>April</i>, but more presents
from the marquiss, attended as before.”</p>

<p><i>April</i> 4th. “This evening the marquiss
and his lady, with the governer and
others came aboard. Nothing is said of
the marquiss his plot; but all chearful
company. The bargain of ransoming
goes on so far, that all the <i>Spanish</i> prisoners
are orderd ashore, except those who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
had rather stay in the prize: but no talk
of money in the case: On the 8th and
9th, the marchioness and the child are
carried ashore, and we salute ’em with
three guns; the marquiss remaining with
us till the performance of articles, which
were signed. The governer has a quantity
of indigo delivered him, and he sends
us a handsom present of beef, which we
are all very glad of. We weighd; leaving
the prize to the <i>Spanish</i> captain, and
are now plying to windward with moderate
gales till</p>

<p><i>April</i> 20th. “We anchor in the gulph
of <i>Amapala</i> in 17 fathom: send the pinnace
to find a watering: the <i>Spaniards</i>
oppose their landing, but suffer them to
put on shore a <i>Spaniard</i> and <i>Indian</i> belonging
to the marquiss, who are going
to <i>Rio Lexos</i> to fetch the ransom money:
but it is my opinion we are all bit.
Not being able to get water at <i>Amapala</i>,
the pinnace is sent to the isle of <i>Tigris</i>;
where they find very good water, and the
<i>Indian</i> who guided them is rewarded with
some clothes. Our men meet with abundance
of game on the island, killing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
good number of deer. Here is also a
great plenty of boobys, which are better
eating than those catch’d at sea. Here
we stay till the 10th of <i>May</i>, much longer
than we intended, in expectation of the
ransom money; but having little reason
to believe the <i>Spaniards</i> will be punctual
and faithful, we unbent our sheet anchor
and stow’d it, taking our departure from
hence, latitude 12 : 36. N.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 20th. “This day, the books, instruments
and clothes of lieutenant <i>Serjeantson</i>
were sold at the mast: being run
ashore in the <i>Rosary</i> pink with his men
as aforesaid. Here I find a strong current
to the N. About this time the cloathing,
linen and other necessaries taken in our
prizes were distributed, being deem’d fair
plunder.”</p>

<p><i>June</i> 4th. “We arrive next at <i>Gorgona</i>,
latitude 2 : 35 N. The current sets to
the eastward. Here is wood and water,
and great plenty of fish; but they wont
take the hook, and we have no seine.
From hence we ply to windward, and
nothing happens till</p>

<p><i>July</i> 25th. “We spy a sail, and come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
up with her: she struck to us, being the
St. <i>Vincent</i> which we took once before,
now commanded by Don <i>Clement de
Andrado</i>, laden with timber and cocoa
nuts from <i>Guiaquil</i> for <i>Lima</i>. We keep
to windward with our prize, and</p>

<p><i>August</i> 11th. “Anchor at <i>Lobos la mar</i>:
the distance from this island, and <i>Lobos
la tierra</i> is 10 leagues. Our chief imployment
here is to catch seal for the
company. Our men have tents on shore,
working in their several stations. Here
we scrub and clean our ship, taking out of
the prize what is most valuable. Our
men, tho’ fatigued with work, live well
and look well, and are now ready for another
cruise. Nothing happens till</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 6th. “A plot is discovered among
the men, wherein the conspirators had
form’d a design to seize the captain and
officers, and run away with the ship: all
who were secured, to be put ashore at
the small desolate isle of <i>Lobos</i>, but the
opposers to be shot. After discovery,
the two principal actors, <i>Joseph Maynard</i>
boatswain’s mate, and <i>James Roch</i> the
ship’s corporal were severely punish’d, besides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
being put in irons: the rest were
pardoned.”</p>

<p>“The cause of this uneasiness among
the men, was their despair of making a
good voyage, having no hope of the <i>Speedwel</i>’s
joyning them, which had brought
them into great straits and difficulties; so
that they did not much care what happen’d.”</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 15th. “Our design of coming
down again to the northward, was to
look into <i>Cheripe</i>, if we could see any
ships there; but chance to fall to the leeward
of it, by reason the currents set us
much to the northward, tho’ we have already
made allowance for the same: we
soon beat up again, finding the coast
alarm’d, and seeing no ship.”</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 17th. “This day sent our pinnace
well arm’d to chase a small vessel which
she came up with, being a fishing boat that
has used to make up her fish on the isle
of <i>Lobos</i>, where we found a good parcel
ready split and salted; besides a handsome
quantity of fresh fish in the boat.
We anchor again at <i>Lobos</i>, in 38 fathom,
and find the S. <i>Vincent</i>, which we left here,
was drove ashore and sunk. We clear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the fishing boat, and send her away with
38 <i>Spanish</i> prisoners: after which we
weigh again and ply to windward, being
in latitude 7 : 00 S. Here the currents
set pretty much to the southward: no
prize, nor any thing occurs, only the burying
four or five of our hands; we hold
our course for the bay of <i>Conception</i>
where we arrive.”</p>

<p><i>November</i> 1st. “Going into the bay we
spy three sail of ships at anchor: the fort
fired a signal gun: we hoisted <i>Spanish</i> colours,
and kept plying up till ten at night:
being moon light, we discover a fourth
ship standing in after us: we bore down
upon her: she haled us in <i>Spanish</i>; we
answer’d her with our guns; but the wind
failing, and she being clean, gained a head
of us. In the morning the pinnace and
launch were sent after her: but soon
left chasing, she being got almost out
of sight. However, we really lost the
substance for the shadow, our captain
now steering for <i>Coquimbo</i>.”</p>

<p>5. “We came up with another sail,
which upon our firing a gun struck her
colours: she is call’d the <i>Solidad</i>: she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
hath a cargo of tobacco, sugar, and cloth
enough to purchase her loading of wheat
at <i>Coquimbo</i>, whither she is bound from
<i>Lima</i>. They inform us that our last
chase had much such another cargo; and
that the two <i>Spanish</i> men of war fitted
out in quest of us and our consort, were
returned to <i>Callao</i> to be victual’d afresh:
and had orders from the viceroy to cruise
on the coast of <i>Chili</i>, not only upon us,
but all the <i>French</i> interloping traders.”</p>

<p>6. “The greatest part these 24 hours
fresh gales of wind and hazy weather,
with a great southern swell. At one this
afternoon, coming open with the harbour
of <i>Coquimbo</i>, we saw three sail of men
of war at anchor, with their topsails loose
in their tops; who, immediately on seeing
us, slipt or cut their cables and stood after
us, we hawling close upon a wind,
our prize doing the same: but she being
the windward-most, and at much the
greatest distance from the enemy, they
judged it necessary to send the best sailer
among them after her: at three the headmost
ship came up with our prize, and
fired at her: upon which she struck: but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
after she had so done, the man of war
fired several guns more into her, the reason
of which we could not ghess: the
other two ships crowded all the sail they
could after us till four, when the biggest
carryed away her mizentop-mast: he then
fired a gun, tacked, and stood in for the
shore again, which we were not very
sorry for: one of them carrying 50, one
40, and the other 26 guns, all clean
ships, <i>French</i> built and sailed well. It
pleased God the wind favour’d us whilst
they continued the chase; so that we weather’d
<i>Isla de pajeros</i>, i. e. the island of
birds which lay just in our way: for if
we had been forced to tack, we must
have been taken.</p>

<p>“We have on board us the captain of
the prize, and eight seamen, besides twelve
<i>Nigros</i>.  There were taken with her,
twelve of our men, besides Mr. <i>Milne</i>
our third lieutenant who commanded her.
However, we had the good luck to ease
her of 97 pound weight of wrought silver,
when she first became our prize.”</p>

<p>Mr. <i>James Milne</i>, whom I have since
had conversation with in <i>London</i>, told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
me that the reason of the enemies continuing
their fire after he had struck to them,
was owing to the rage of the captain to find
him a <i>Spanish</i> prize instead of an <i>English</i>
privatier; and vexed at this mistake, he
could not immediately quit his passion, but
struck <i>Milne</i> upon the head with his drawn
sword. However, the captain soon after
sent for him up, and finding him almost
stript by the soldiers, generously asked his
pardon, and order’d him a complete sute
of apparel from top to toe. The captain’s
name was <i>Don Blas de Lesso</i> and had been
a guard marine in the <i>French</i> service where
he lost one of his legs. I mention this to
the honour of the said gentleman, who kept
Mr. <i>Milne</i> aboard him all the time the men
of war were in quest of us and the <i>French</i>
interlopers, using him very kindly: and tho’
he was carried prisoner to <i>Lima</i>, the said
captain soon got him his liberty, procured
him his passage gratis to <i>Panama</i>, and gave
him a jar of brandy, and a jar of wine for
his sea store; beside 200 dollars for his expenses
to <i>England</i>. But I am sorry to hear
he never acknowledged it by letter from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
<i>Panama</i> or elsewhere; the said <i>Don Blas</i>
having spoke of it to a particular gentleman,
then factor for the <i>British South-Sea</i>
company at <i>Panama</i>.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 7th. “This day our agent
Mr. <i>Godfrey</i>, and Mr. <i>Cook</i> second lieutenant,
had words about a pair of gold buckles,
which the later had got privately in
his keeping. The lieutenant gave Mr.
<i>Godfrey</i> very scurrilous language: but our
agent insisted, that it was his immediate
province to inspect all such matters. Whether
<i>Cook</i> keeps the buckles I know not:
but he went in a very unmannerly way
to captain <i>Clipperton</i> and told him he
would no longer take the charge of the
watch: whereupon Mr. <i>Chambers</i> the
master took that charge in his room. The
next day the clothes and other things belonging
to our people, taken by the man
of war, were sold publicly at the mast.
Being thus worsted at <i>Coquimbo</i>, and
forced to fly their men of war; remembring
our mistakes at <i>Conception</i>, and that
we must now abandon these coasts with
short provisions, and no hopes of captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
<i>Shelvocke</i>, we begin to be much dejected.
However we keep jogging on the
northward, and</p>

<p>14. “Make the isle of St. <i>Gallan</i>, whose
latitude I find 13 : 42 S. On the 15th.
stood into the road of <i>Pisco</i>; but finding
nothing, we stood out again, holding to
the northward.”</p>

<p>16. “See a sail and give chase. She
hoisted <i>Spanish</i> colours and fired a gun;
and finding that she could wrong us, she
hawld up her courses, and took in all
her small sails: we let fly our topgallant
sheets, firing three guns to windward,
that being the signal between our ship and
the <i>Speedwel</i>, in case we should meet.
The chase holding her wind, we could
not come near her. The next day at
two in the afternoon she tacked, and
stood for us, as if resolved to ingage us:
we edgd on towards her, ’till we got
within a mile or thereabouts, when she
fired several guns at us, which we return’d
with a broadside: upon which she
held her wind again, and stood to the
westward; and being just cleaned, and
a prime sailor, went at least two foot for our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
one; so that we soon found we had no
share in her.”</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Taylor</i> is very right; for I my self
was in this sham fight. I call it so, because
I believe neither of the commanders
had any great stomach for a battle. In the
first place, it was contrary to the orders of
captain <i>Fitzgerald</i> who commanded this
ship called the <i>Flying Fish</i>: for being ready
to sail for <i>Cales</i>, he was only now order’d
out by the viceroy in quest of <i>Shelvocke</i>;
of whom news was brought to <i>Lima</i>, that
he had a day or two before taken the <i>Jesu
Maria</i> out of <i>Pisco</i>, leaving the <i>Spaniards</i>
the bark he built at <i>Fernandes</i>. <i>Pisco</i> being
but a little to windward of <i>Callao</i>, they
were in hopes of catching <i>Shelvocke</i> as he
went to leeward: and the <i>Flying Fish</i> having
a very considerable treasure aboard, the
captain was strictly order’d to forbear attacking,
or speaking with any imbarkation, except
<i>Shelvocke</i>. On the other hand, <i>Clipperton</i>
may well be supposed willing enough
to decline ingaging with a ship just come
out of harbour with 200 fresh men aboard;
at a time when his people were in a very
low condition and dispirited, as appears by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the journal: neither had he half the number
of men. So that I am of opinion if
the dollars had been left ashore, the <i>Flying
Fish</i> would have been able to carry <i>Clipperton</i>
into <i>Callao</i>. For <i>Fitzgerald</i>, who was
a <i>St. Malo</i> man, had aboard him a hundred
townsmen, stout fellows; and the rest
were the best hands he could pick out of
all the ships at <i>Callao</i> for this occasion.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 18th. “<i>Maltesi</i> one of the
<i>Guara</i> islands bore N. E. one league; from
whence I take my departure in latitude
11 : 10 S. Being fine weather we heel’d
and scrubb’d both sides of our ship. We
stood in for <i>Guanchaco</i>: but finding nothing
there, bore away for <i>Cheripe</i>: where
seeing nothing, we stood away for <i>Payta</i>,
designing to try our fortune at every port
to the northward; particularly to get a
supply of flower, which being now all
expended, we have three pound of <i>Indian</i>
corn served to a mess of six men each.”</p>

<p>27. “Saw point <i>Helen</i>: shorten’d sail
and stood from the land. Hoisted out the
pinnace and yawl to set the prisoners
ashore belonging to the last prize retaken
by the enemy. After which we steer to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
the westward for the <i>Gallipagos</i> islands,
in order to refresh our men, who are
very bad with the scurvy.”</p>

<p>30. “Had an observation, and find my
self in latitude 00 : 09 N. Here is a strong
current to the northward, and I believe
a little westerly. I am 22 miles more
northerly than the log gives, variation
and leeway having been allow’d. All
our bread, flower, and <i>Indian</i> corn is
now expended, and we have but one
little meal in 24 hours; which is a small
piece of <i>English</i> beef (being yet very
good) and calivances. Six men in a mess.”</p>

<p><i>December</i> 4th. “Mr. <i>Thomas Fairman</i>
our purser departed this life; and we committed
him to the deep. Measur’d our
logline and find it three fathom too short,
which amounts to 52 mile one hour with
another since we left cape <i>Helen</i>. Having
an observation, I rectify my account
and find the latitude 00 : 36 N. We
keep plying to windward against a strong
S. W. current in sight of the <i>Gallipagos</i>.”</p>

<p>6th. “Sent the pinnace to discover an
anchoring place at one of the islands: returns
without finding any; but saw abundance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of tortoise ashore. Send the
pinnace and yawl to get some. They return
with fish enough to serve the company
a day: But there running a prodigious
surf, they could not land, or look
for turtle. We kept plying off and on, and
sounded in foul ground from 80 to 50
fath; the latitude of the island I make 9
minutes N. ’tis a mere rock: so we left
it, and steer’d away for another S. W. being
the same which the <i>Spaniards</i> make
to lye under the equator. We run along
shore but can find no anchoring: so that
being unwilling to lose more time, we
make our best way to the isle of <i>Cocos</i>,
where we hope certainly to get fish, fowl,
and coco-nuts; our people being very
sick and weak.”</p>

<p>7th and 8th. “We had several islands
N. E. but on the 9th got clear of them
all. This day I took charge of the captain’s
watch, and Mr. <i>Chambers</i> the larboard,
Mr. <i>Davison</i> being sick, and
lieutenant <i>Cook</i> still refusing his duty. Little
happens in this passage, but burying
two or three of our hand. Our people
fall apace; therefore are in pain lest we
miss the island.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>17. “Going very slowly ahead, find
there is a southern current. Lye so till
day light, believing we are near the
island. At nine forenoon with joy we
beheld the island <i>Cocos</i> about nine leagues
N. W.”</p>

<p>18. “Anchor in 13 fathom white sand.
Here all our people and the marquiss <i>de
Villa Roche</i> got ashore, where we build
a house for the sick men. Here is abundance
of good fish round the island which
we take pains to catch, the surf being
sometimes very great. Our people find
here plenty of coco-nuts, crabs, boobies
and their eggs, this being their hatching
time. Our captain broaches the last hogshead
of brandy, allowing every man a
dram a day: and on new-years-day gave
the people a gallon of strong beer for
six. This food, ease, and refreshment
pretty well recover’d all our company.
We wood and water, tho’ with much difficulty;
for here is a great swell coming
in from the northward constantly at full
moon and change: therefore are forced
to wait ’till the spring tides are abated before
we can get any thing off.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p><i>January</i> 17. 1721. “The marquiss
came aboard as do most of our people,
being ready to sail. Eight nigros and three
of our men desert here, and abscond in
the woods. The names of our men are
<i>Higgins</i>, <i>Caulker</i> and <i>Shingle</i>. The anchorage
here being rocky, we have sadly
gaul’d both our cables. After continuing
here a month, we weigh and set sail,
from whence I take my departure, <i>January</i>
20th. latitude 05 : 38 N. running now
to the northward on the coast of <i>Mexico</i>.”</p>

<p>23. “We spy a sail to which give
chase, and send the pinnace to keep
sight of her: but at night she gives us
the slip.”</p>

<p>25. “This morning I see the coast of
<i>Mexico</i>. About seven we made a sail:
at 11 she struck to our pinnace: which
returns and brings account that she is
the <i>Jesu Maria</i> a <i>Spanish</i> ship, but now
in the possession of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>,
who commands her. That he has about
40 of his men aboard, the rest being all
dead or dispersed. That he lost the <i>Speedwel</i>
at <i>Fernandes</i>; where they stay’d five
months, and built a barque out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
<i>Speedwel</i>’s wreck, with which they put
to sea, and coasted along <i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i>
meeting several ships, but could do nothing
with them; ’till they came to <i>Pisco</i>
near <i>Lima</i>, where they took this prize,
being the ship we went in there to look
for. They differ much in their account:
but have no regular command among
them, being all alike as the <i>West-India</i>
privatiers. They have chose a quartermaster,
carrying every thing by a majority
of votes: so that we find, they have
quite broke their articles with the owners,
and have shared all among themselves.”</p>

<p>27. “Perceived captain <i>Shelvocke</i> to
hoist St. <i>George</i>’s colours at main-top-masthead,
firing three guns at intervals,
being signals to speak with us. We lye
to for his boat, which came aboard with
a letter for captain <i>Clipperton</i>; who immediately
sent back the boat for their
purser to be examined concerning their
actions on the coast of <i>Brasil</i>, and in the
rest of their absence from us. Sent away
the boat: but the purser Mr. <i>Hendrie</i>
stays; who gives but a dark story of their
procedings; and that he was not allow’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
to take any account of the treasure for
the owners. At eight captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
came aboard being sent for by our captain
and agent to give an account of his
transactions. The boat brought Mr. <i>Dod</i>
their lieutenant of marines to continue
with us; he having been used very ill
for standing up for the owners interest.”</p>

<p>28. “Came aboard from captain <i>Shelvocke</i>,
six chests of pitch and dammer, and
two barrels of tar, with six slabs of copper.
Captain <i>Clipperton</i> spares him two of our
quarterdeck guns, some great and
small shot, a compass, and a few other
necessaries. His people have laid out a
great deal of money with us for clothes,
shoes, hats, <i>&amp;c.</i> Captain <i>Shelvocke</i> goes
aboard and parts company. Here remain
with us two of the <i>Speedwel</i>’s officers,
Mr. <i>Hendrie</i> the purser and Mr. <i>Dod</i>
lieutenant of marines, designing with us
for China. We keep to the northward
on the coast of <i>Mexico</i>, meeting with
strong west and north-west currents ’till
latitude 15 : 00 where they set S. E. In
this passage we have met captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
three times without speaking, whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
we knew by his making the signals. Our
men have caught some tortoise, which
has been very acceptable, but nothing
material happens in all these traverses till
<i>March</i> 7th. “Our officers consult, and
resolve to joyn captain <i>Shelvocke</i> the next
time we meet, in order to attempt the
<i>Acapulco</i> ship homeward bound.”</p>

<p>13th. “Made a sail, which by the signals
proving to be captain <i>Shelvocke</i>, we
brought to. He comes aboard with his
lieutenants. Our captain and they agree
in general, that if we meet the <i>Manilla</i>
ship, <i>Shelvocke</i>’s company to joyn us,
and run her aboard at once. Accordingly
we cruise for her: and on the 15th
captain <i>Clipperton</i> holds another consultation;
wherein proposals being agreed
on, are sign’d and sent to captain <i>Shelvocke</i>;
<i>That if he and his crew would
refund all the money shared among themselves
contrary to their articles with the
owners, and agree to put it in a joynt
stock, then all faults should be forgot;
both companies would unite, and procede
to cruise for the <span class="antiqua">Acapulco</span> ship</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>17. “Not hearing from captain <i>Shelvocke</i>,
and the time for the <i>Manilla</i> ship
setting out being several days past: Resolved
in a council to make our best dispatch
for <i>East India</i>. We have an infirm
ship’s company, and but five months provision,
which must serve us to <i>China</i> unless
we get a supply at <i>Guam</i>.”</p>

<p>“At six in the evening, the westmost
land in sight, which I take to be <i>port
Marquiss</i> bore N. N. W. eight leagues;
from whence I take my departure, it lying
in 16 : 50 north latitude.”</p>

<p><i>May</i> 10th. “This day at noon we make
<i>Serpana</i> one of the <i>Ladron</i> islands, <i>Guam</i>
being a few leagues farther ahead. The
latitude of <i>Serpana</i> I find to be 13 : 42
N. and the difference of longitude from
<i>port Marquiss</i> 121 : 08 W. Nothing
worth notice has happen’d in this tedious
passage, only burying six of our hands.
All our people are very weak, and take
the scurvy apace: so that land is now a
very welcome sight.”</p>

<p>13. “Anchor at the island of <i>Guam</i>.
Send the pinnace ashore with a flag of
truce. They tell our lieutenant, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
cannot trade with us without leave from
the Governer.”</p>

<p>16. “A prow came from the governer
with Mr. <i>Godfrey</i> our agent, acquainting
us, that we may be supply’d
with provisions. Accordingly our launch
brought aboard some cattle, bread, sugar,
brandy and fruit. The next day his honour
sent us a handsome present of palm
wine, sugar and chocolate; for which we
drink his health with a complement of
seven guns.”</p>

<p><i>May</i> 18th. “The marquiss <i>de Villa
Roche</i> our prisoner, went ashore in company
with our agent, the first lieutenant
and doctor, having agreed with the governer
about his ransom. We give him
five guns at landing. Our launch is imploy’d
these six days in bringing wood,
and water, and provision aboard: during
which time the governer desired he might
have some arms and ammunition in exchange.
Accordingly captain <i>Clipperton</i>
sends him twelve fuzees, three jars of
powder, sixty round shot, four pair of
pistols; beside cutlases, long swords and
daggers.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>25. “Receive a letter, wherein the governer
demands the marquiss’s jewels,
some consecrated plate, and two <i>Nigros</i>
being christians and subjects to the king
of <i>Spain</i>: as also a certificate under the
captain and officers hands that peace was
proclaimed; detaining Mr. <i>Godfrey</i> and
Mr. <i>Pritty</i> ’till all this is performd. Hereupon
our captain sends a letter with a
certificate that the <i>Solidad</i>, the last prize
we took on the coast of <i>Chili</i>, told us
there was a peace between <i>England</i> and
<i>Spain</i>; but withal assured the governer
that if he did not in 24 hours send the
ransom with the two gentlemen, he would
demolish the houses upon the shore, burn
the ship in the harbour, and do all the
mischief he could at the <i>Philippine</i> islands.
In the mean time we receive a letter that
the governer will pay for the consecrated
plate, and desires more powder
and shot. To which our captain sends
answer that he will not spare any more
ammunition or the <i>Nigros</i>.”</p>

<p>28. “Our yawl went ashore for more
provision: but the officer of the village
told us we should have no more, unless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
we sent more powder and shot: upon
which we immediately weighd, staying
for no answer by Mr. <i>Godfrey</i> or Mr.
<i>Pritty</i>. Sent the pinnace ahead to sound,
and made the best of our way to the ship
in the harbour. The people ashore had
raised a battery during this sham treaty,
from whence they began to fire at our
pinnace; which being returned gave account
that what channel they found, was
within pistol shot of the shore. At six
afternoon, in making up to the ship, we
run aground, they having carry’d her into
shoal water: so that now we sustain
two fires together, one from the battery
over our heads, and another from the
ship. At nine we got foul of the rocks
where we cut away two of our anchors
indeavouring to get the ship off; during
which time the enemy fired so warmly
with stones and shot from a new battery
erected on a hill, that we suffer’d
extremely in our hull and rigging. We
have three men wounded, beside the misfortune
of losing Mr. <i>Davison</i> our first
lieutenant who was an honest fellow and
a good officer. Thus the <i>Success</i> is forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
to lye in a miserable condition exposed
to the continual fire of the enemy, who
in the night have still this advantage of
us; that the surface of the water being
smooth as a millpond easily shows them
our position, whereas we have no other
direction for our aim than the flashes of
their guns.”</p>

<p>29. “In this emergence our captain being
overcome with liquor, and quite unable
to command the ship; we officers
came to a resolution of running out clear
of the enemy as soon as we could get
the ship afloat, and signed a paper to
indemnify Mr. <i>Cook</i> if he would take upon
him the command. At four afternoon
we set her floating and cut away the small
bower anchor; but in ten minutes we run
aground again: at seven carry out the
kedge anchor; but in heaving, the hawser
broke. We immediately carry out another
hawser with a lower deck gun to
it, having now lost all our anchors and
still aground. At two forenoon, the
enemy hale us several times to surrender
or except no quarter. At five, carry out
the maintopmast-shroud hawser on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
starboard bow with another gun; still plying
the enemy with our great guns below,
and small arms on the poop. We
do them little mischief; tho’ they never
miss us, especially our boats as soon as
they see them stir. At eleven forenoon,
carry out the rest of the small bower,
with two lower deck guns right ahead
into five fathom: we clear away the
hold ready to start our water to make the
ship lighter: got our upper and lower
deck guns forward to bring her by the
head, the ship hanging abaft on a rock:
we keep two guns out of the stern ports,
continually firing at the enemies new battery;
but can’t bring them to bear. These
twenty four hours we have happily only
one wounded: but the ship is wretchedly
paid off between wind and water.”</p>

<p>30. “At six afternoon the ship floating,
we cut away the yawl being sunk with
the shot: the other boats are much damaged:
hove to our small bower; then
cut away it, and the other two hawsers,
and sent the pinnace ahead to tow the
ship off. Just as we got afloat, the enemy
fired so smartly from the new battery that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
their shot raked us through between wind
and water, killing one of our people,
and wounding two others. Thus have we
lost both our bower anchors and cables,
the stream and kedge anchors, four hawsers,
four of our lower deck guns, nineteen
barrels of powder, two men kill’d
and six wounded: having stood these
fifty hours, a fair mark for the enemy
to fire at: and if we had not got clear,
I do believe they would have sunk us
before morning. We are all very sorry
for Mr. <i>Godfrey</i> and Mr. <i>Pritty</i>, not
knowing how the governer may use them
ashore. At ten afternoon we brought to,
and begin to splice our rigging, not a
rope of which has escaped a shot: As
for the masts and yards, they have all
been severely pepper’d, and the carpenters
have been all night stopping the holes
in the ship’s bottom. At seven forenoon
stow our guns in the hold, bar in the
ports, hoist in the launch and pinnace,
and at noon steer away west with an
easy sail, hoping to save our passage before
the <i>Monsoons</i> come on. Wind at
S. S. E.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>31. “Our carpenters are imployed in
fishing the masts and yards, and the rest
of our people in fixing the rigging. At
six afternoon, the body of the island <i>Guam</i>
bore E. seven leagues, from whence I take
my departure, north latitude 13 : 20. allowing
half a point N. E. variation, designing
now for <i>China</i>. Nothing remarkable
till</p>

<p><i>June 23.</i> “Find our ship to be in a
very weak condition, scarce a whole timber
in her upper works: discover one of
our fashion pieces to be shot through,
which being the chief support of the after
part of the ship, we are obliged to frap
her, to keep her together: it blowing
pretty fresh, we dare not carry sail; having
been forced for a week past to feud
under bare poles through variable winds
and bad weather. We impatiently look
out for land, being afraid the currents
have forcibly set us much to the eastward.”</p>

<p>24. “At day break, find our selves among
several islands, one of which is
<i>Barbuon</i> at the north point of the island
<i>Luconia</i>. I saw also seven rocks, mark’d
in some draughts; and likewise other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
islands, mark’d in some manuscripts with
a figure of 5, and by captain <i>Dampier</i>
called the <i>Bashee</i> islands. <i>Dampier</i>’s account
and mine agree: but by Dr. <i>Halley</i>’s
chart to <i>Luconia</i>, my reckoning is
out by above three degrees; except he
means the south cape of <i>Luconia</i> which
may reconcile the difference. From <i>June</i>
14th to 19th. I found the current set to
the southward; but whether W. or E.
I know not: and from thence chiefly
northward.”</p>

<p>30. “Make the isle and shoals of <i>Prata</i>
latitude 20 : 46 N. The longitude from
<i>Barbuon</i> to it is 4 : 46 W.”</p>

<p><i>July</i> 1st. “Saw a sail to the eastward
which we take to be a <i>China</i> junk. At
six forenoon see other islands, and several
boats a fishing. At nine forenoon bent
the sheet cable: sounded in 30 fathom
clay ground. At noon had the islands
from N. N. E. to W. by S.: these lands
were never mark’d in any chart. Longitude
from <i>Prata</i> 2 west.”</p>

<p>2. “Anchor in 13 fathom: send away
the pinnace for intelligence how <i>Macao</i>
bore. Return’d with a boat and three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
<i>Chinese</i>, of whom we could only understand,
that <i>Canton</i> was to S. W. of us;
so we parted, and had the land from N.
E. to W. of us: soundings from 22 to
13 fathom.”</p>

<p>3. “We gain nothing to windward:
but are further to leeward of <i>Macao</i>
than we expected. We can get no pilot,
and so bear away for <i>Amoy</i>: at six afternoon
made the white rock lying near
the main land: at seven forenoon saw
several boats a fishing: had 21 fathom
clay ground.”</p>

<p>4. “At six afternoon saw the land N.
E, and several islands laid down in the
charts. Have had soundings from 30 to 15
fathom, latitude <i>per</i> observation 23 : 40.”</p>

<p>5. “Not knowing the way into <i>Amoy</i>,
and not being the length as yet, hold
upon a wind designing to ply off and on
’till daylight. At six afternoon saw the
range of islands that run to <i>Amoy</i>: the
eastermost bore S. S. W; the southmost
N. N. W. At four forenoon made a sail;
have had several boats aboard to sell us
fish, but can’t understand them. Soundings
from 22 to 14 fathom good ground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
At ten forenoon saw the <i>Piscadore</i> islands
from S. S. E. to E. S. E. 8 leagues.”</p>

<p>6. “At five afternoon came to with
our sheet anchor in the gulf of <i>Amoy</i>.
Longitude from <i>Barbuon</i> W. 4 : 48. Blessed
be God in our passage hither, from the
24 of <i>June</i> we have had pleasant gales and
serene weather, the winds between west
and S. W. At ten the <i>Hoppo</i>’s men come
aboard to know what we do here. Told
them we was a king’s ship. They wrote
down particularly our force and number
of men, desiring us to be faithful in our
account. The very next morning our
men, in a mutinous manner, demand of
captain <i>Clipperton</i> their prize money, alledging
that the <i>Success</i> could never put
to sea again. The first man that attacked
the captain was <i>John Dennison</i>. I interposed
thinking it my duty; whereupon
<i>Edward Boreman</i> bid me desist, or expect
a brace of balls thro’ my head: Mr.
<i>Cook</i> with a sneer said, let the poor man
rest and take breath a little, meaning the
captain: upon this our captain went ashore
to the <i>Hoppo</i> or commissioner of
the customs. During these four days we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
receive aboard a great quantity of rice,
some cattle, fowl, wood and water. On
the 12th, the officers go ashore and are
handsomly received by the <i>Hoppo</i>, with
whom we make an agreement to anchor
in the harbour and lye the monsoons
out. Two <i>Hoppo</i> men or customhouse-officers
are sent aboard to hinder private
dealing with the natives. Several <i>Mandarins</i>
or noblemen visit the ship with the
<i>Hoppo</i>. Some of the men go ashore without
leave, for which our captain going to
correct them, the whole crew unite and
resist. We get more provision aboard;
after which the <i>Hoppo</i>’s agent receives
the port charges, being 1700 dollars, about
400 pound sterling. Our captain receives
a present of wine and fruit from one of
the <i>Mandarins</i>. Nothing material till</p>

<p><i>August</i> 25th. “We officers sign a paper
for the captain to allow all the ships company
money to buy necessaries. Captain
<i>Mitchel</i> being gone, and <i>Davison</i> we
succeded him being kill’d, <i>Cook</i> violently
insists upon having thirty shares as
second captain: which by his own management
with the men, we were forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
to yield him: but when the question was
put to make provision for the gentlemen
who were kill’d or taken from us, and
the two officers from the <i>Speedwel</i>, <i>Hendrie</i>
and <i>Dod</i> who are passengers with
us, <i>Cook</i> was first man to oppose and
reject it: so that we settle the shares as
well as we can. Our captain and most
of the officers are willing to allow something
to the two passengers aforesaid;
captain <i>Shelvocke</i> having used them ill for
favouring the owners interest, particularly
Mr. <i>Hendrie</i> the agent whom he would
not suffer to act, but made him swab the
deck: however the company murmur at
making them an allowance, and I doubt
they will receive nothing. After this we
fall into great disorders and confusion,
and the men are strangely set against the
captain, refusing to work without their
whole prize money, and complain to
the chief <i>Mandarin</i> call’d <i>Hyhung</i>: upon
which captain <i>Clipperton</i> is sent for, who
represented, that according to our articles,
the capture ought to be shared at
<i>London</i>. However <i>Cook</i> goes secretly to
the <i>Mandarin</i> and underhand favours the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
men, insinuating that they would be
cheated; and threaten’d, if <i>Clipperton</i> did
not easily comply, to tell the <i>Mandarin</i>
of his fine doings at <i>Guam</i>, and the great
loss of captain <i>Mitchel</i> sent in the <i>Chichley</i>
prize with a good cargo never since heard
of: So that in short there came a guard
of soldiers aboard of us, and an order to
captain <i>Clipperton</i> to divide all the shares
and pay them.”</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 16th. “Which was done this day
without reserving anything for <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
two officers, our dead men, or
thole who were taken prisoners.”</p>

<p><i>Taylor</i> not having here, or at leaving
<i>China</i>, mention’d any thing of what became
of <i>Clipperton</i>, or the gentlemens money, I
think proper to insert that account as I had
it from one of our owners and several of
the <i>Success</i>’s people. The owners moiety
consisting of dollars, wrought silver, gold
and jewels amounted to upwards of 6000<i>l.</i>
sterling, and was put aboard a <i>Portuguese
East-India</i> man, called the <i>Queen</i> of <i>Angels</i>,
<i>Don Francisco la Vero</i> commander, which
was unfortunately burnt at <i>Rio Janeiro</i> on
the coast of <i>Brasil</i>, <i>June</i> 6th 1722; of which
effects no more came to hand than 1800<i>l.</i>
As for captain <i>Clipperton</i>, he having sold
the <i>Success</i> in <i>China</i>, took his passage in her
to <i>Batavia</i>; and from thence in a <i>Dutch</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
<i>India</i> man he came to <i>Holland</i>. He stay’d
there a few weeks upon his own affairs,
and went directly to his family at <i>Galway</i>
in <i>Ireland</i>, where he died two days after his
arrival, in the year 22: being an <i>Englishman</i>
born at great <i>Yarmouth</i>, in the county of
<i>Norfolk</i>. But more of this in another place.
I procede to the journal.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 25th. “Weighed out of <i>Amoy</i>
harbour. Our arms, ammunition, and sails
came aboard: it being a practice, with
the <i>Chinese</i>, for their security, to take these
ashore from all strangers.”</p>

<p>30. “Weighed and run out of the gulf,
from whence I take my departure, latitude
24 N: designing now for <i>Macao</i> an island
belonging to his <i>Portuguese</i> majesty.”</p>

<p><i>October</i> 4th. “Anchor in the road of
<i>Macao</i>: salute the fort: captain goes ashore
and returns with the commander
of a <i>Portuguese</i> man of war. Here we
are informed of peace in <i>Europe</i>. <i>Cook</i>
and <i>Veitch</i> go to <i>Canton</i> to consult with
Mr. <i>Winder</i> supercargo of an <i>India</i> man
and son to one of our owners, what our
captain is to do with the <i>Success</i>. Upon
their return the ship is condemned, being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
uncapable to procede for <i>England</i>;
and is sold for about 4000 dollars, much
too cheap.</p>

<p>“Here I settle my account of time, and
find I have lost a day coming westward
round the world; therefore I allow but
six days for this week and go on.”</p>

<p>30. “Twenty of us agreed here, at six
dollars each, to go to <i>Canton</i> in a boat
with chests and bedding, and get a passage
from thence to <i>England</i>: but it was
my good hap to miss going in her, losing
only my money; for she was taken by
the pyrates: and some of our people now
at <i>Canton</i> have lost their things: So that
seven of us agree for a <i>Mandarin</i>’s boat
at twenty dollars each, finding it unsafe
to go otherwise: we anchored at a town
half way to <i>Canton</i>, being obliged to get
into a private boat, while the <i>Mandarin</i>
convoyed us in sight of <i>Canton</i>. In our
passage we saw a pyrate take a boat; and
I find it is a common practice. I think
it very scandalous: but probably the <i>Chinese</i>
government wink at it.”</p>

<p><i>November</i> 4th. “We arrive at the <i>English</i>
factory at <i>Canton</i>: are very kindly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
received. They meet, and agree to carry
us to <i>Great Britain</i> at five pound a man,
being a very great favour: Accordingly
we all pay our money. I and two or
three more went aboard the <i>Maurice</i>,
captain <i>Peacock</i> at <i>Wampo</i>, being the
place where the <i>European</i> ships lye about
three leagues down <i>Canton</i> river.
The rest of our company divide in several
ships.”</p>

<p>9. “We made sail in company of the
<i>Macclesfield</i> an <i>English East India</i> man,
and an <i>Ostender</i> call’d the <i>House</i> of <i>Austria</i>.”</p>

<p>13. “The grand <i>Ladron</i> island bore
N. E. four leagues; from whence I take
my departure. Latitude 22. N.”</p>

<p>The run from <i>China</i> to <i>Great Britain</i> being
generally well known, it is foreign to
my purpose to extract any more of this journal.
I here give Mr. <i>Taylor</i> my hearty thanks
for the use of it: and am pleas’d I can do
it in this public manner. Without it, I
could not have been able in some particulars
to confute the false and treacherous relation
given by captain <i>Shelvocke</i>; who
never kept any journal himself, or suffer’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
any one to use pen and ink, but his own
creatures. If Mr. <i>Taylor</i> had designd to publish
his account, he doubtless might have
enterd remarks and occurrences of another
nature than those which concern navigation
and geography. And altho’ the expedition
of these two ships faild in all its best particulars,
yet a good journal of their procedings
round the whole ocean might have
been entertaining: for men love to read
of enterprizes, tho’ they prove unfortunate.</p>

<p>Lastly, I must observe to Mr. <i>Taylor</i>’s
credit, that he has kept his account truly
and carefully like an honest man and a good
artist; having judiciously markd the currents
and rectifyd the latitudes of many places.
He arrivd at <i>Batavia</i> in <i>December</i>; at the
cape of <i>Good Hope</i> in <i>February</i>; at St. <i>Helena</i>
and <i>Ascension</i> in <i>March</i>; and in <i>May</i>
1722, at <i>London</i>: having thus made a complete
tour of the globe.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Here</span>
I resume the history of my
captain, whom I left cruising off
<i>Payta</i>; while <i>Hatley</i>, I, and the rest
of us were taken by admiral <i>Midranda</i>,
otherwise call’d general of the <i>South-Sea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> having hitherto failed of making
his fortune, begins now to think it too
late, at least for this season. The scheme
of our voyage is at an end; the enemy is
alarm’d; their ships all laid up, except the
two <i>Spanish</i> men of war which are in quest
of the <i>English</i> privatiers: and <i>Shelvocke</i>
probably would now be glad of his commodore
<i>Clipperton</i>’s company. But finding as
he says p. 199, his circumstances to be in
an extreme melancholy posture; he sails
back to windward, and resolves upon a
new experiment, which was to get rid of
the owners ship, and cruise upon a new
bottom: thereby thinking to intitle himself
to all he should get, exclusive of us prisoners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
and the gentlemen at home. And this
is captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s law and, conscience,
and the real shift he now makes to dispute
it with the gentlemen who fitted him out.</p>

<p>Accordingly he sails to <i>Fernandes</i>, where
he arriv’d the beginning of <i>May</i>, being
winter in that hemisphere. He was too
good a seaman to believe he could ride it
out the remaining part of the winter, in a
wild road, destitute of any kind of shelter,
and exposed to strong gusts of northerly
winds which frequently blow there in that
season: he well knew there was no meddling
with the coast for the enemies men
of war: therefore he makes half the tour
of the island, seemingly to push her into
some creek; after which, he comes to in
the usual place, with only one anchor to
trust to; for he had taken care to have no
more. Here the ship rode several days safe
enough: and during his stay, seventeen of
his men are sent ashore, while others were
imploy’d in getting off water to favour a
false design of going to sea again: and under
this pretence of watering, both now and
after, many things of value were secretly
carry’d ashore, which the people in general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
wonder’d to see there, and could not
imagine who brought them. However, the
more effectually to put his project in execution,
he weighs from this place, and comes
to anchor close in shore: upon which his
people unanimously fear some very odd mischievous
design, and suddenly recollect how
they had often heard him say, That it was
not difficult living at <i>Fernandes</i>, if a man
should accidentally be thrown there, since
Mr. <i>Selkirk</i> had continu’d upon it four years
by himself.</p>

<p>Possest with these things, the people were
amaz’d, that their captain would leave a
clear berth and good anchoring to venture
farther in, where it was foul and rocky; and
where if the cable parted there could be
but little hopes to save the ship: whereas
in their first situation they had clear anchoring,
room and drift enough to get their
tacks aboard, to claw it off either to the
east or westward. As soon as the anchor
was down, Mr. <i>Brook</i> the first lieutenant
advised flinging two of their heaviest guns,
which, in case of losing the anchor, might
bring her up a little ’till they could set
the sails: But <i>Shelvocke</i> rejected all these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
things with a stedfast tranquillity, and now
says he had no opportunity of getting to
sea in four days, tho’ he was ready: which
I am sure is an absurdity wants clearing
up, p. 205. Moreover, how can <i>Shelvocke</i>
impose this sham readiness on mankind,
when his seventeen hands are all at this time
on the island, and who he owns came down
so seasonably to his assistance, as soon as the
ship touched the shore? Here, he says, a
hard gale of wind came from the sea, which
brought in such a tumbling swell, that in
a few hours the cable parted, the ship struck,
and all the masts went overboard.</p>

<p>This is the plausible reason he gives for
losing his ship, being a wind rais’d only in
his brain, and of his own invention: for
’tis a most notorious falshood, to say, there
was any gale when the cable parted: all
his people have in one word assur’d me and
many others to the contrary. And <i>Shelvocke</i>
very well knew, that if he should
be catched by a gale in that perilous road-stead,
and so poorly found with ground
tackle, they must all inevitably have perish’d,
by reason of the prodigious breach
the sea makes in any thing of weather against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
the sunken rocks and stones all along
the shore. He therefore took care to secure
all their lives by destroying his ship in
fine serene weather, which the ingenious
captain perform’d by bringing a spring on
his cable, with which he hove his ship’s broadside
against the swell, and kept her in that
position ’till the cable was tore asunder.
Mr. <i>Dod</i>, who pretends not to be a seaman,
says, that about three hours before the ship
went ashore, some hands were at work on
the quarter deck hawling in a hawser which
was made fast to the cable; and that he
inquir’d of <i>Gilbert Henderson</i> the gunner,
what that was for? <i>Henderson</i> answer’d
him, that if he would be rightly inform’d,
he must go and ask the captain. To confirm
this, several of his people have made
<i>affidavit</i>, that it blew no wind at all, that
every soul of them got commodiously ashore,
and that it’s their belief he lost the
ship on purpose: and its remarkable, he
made not one tryal to prevent it.</p>

<p>Soon as the cable parted, Mr. <i>Laport</i> his
third lieutenant seeing immediate ruine,
cry’d out, Set the foresail; hoping thereby
to do some good: and while <i>Edmund Philips</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
and others were actually upon the yard,
<i>Shelvocke</i> hastily order’d them down, and
taking the helm in his hand, said, Ne’re
mind it boys; stand all fast, i’ll lay her on a
feather bed: which, as it proved a plaguy
hard one, shews his great indifference as
to the event of the ship.</p>

<p>Page 26. He brags of his being thirty years
an officer in the navy: what then must we
say to a man of such experience, who will
lavishly destroy two or three ships, and save
not an anchor and cable for a time of need?
There’s nothing can excuse it, but owning
what I have been proving. Either way it’s
very bad: his judgment and his honesty
being both in great danger.</p>

<p>Another circumstance comes in here&mdash;When
we met <i>La Jonquiere</i> at St. <i>Catherine</i>’s,
<i>Shelvocke</i> procur’d of him a pair of
smith’s bellows and forge, p. 29, which at
that time we could see no manner of occasion
for: but without them, ’tis now evident,
he could never have made bolts, spikes,
nails and other iron work for a barque able
to carry fifty or sixty men to sea; and in
short, without the bellows, he could never
have begun such a piece of work at all. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
am sure none of us mistrusted then, that
the <i>Speedwel</i> was to be lost; tho’ our captain
had a greater foresight, and provided
accordingly. Sometimes indeed, large burdensome
ships that strain and labour much
in a grown sea, and often snap their bolts
and chainplates, may want such a thing; but
a lively handy vessel like ours of 170 ton,
had no more occasion for a pair of smith’s
bellows than a great cathedral organ.</p>

<p>I offer not these things as clear demonstrations,
but circumstances only; for it is impossible
in this case to go farther: and there’s
no room for any other sort of proof in a
fact where a man has no conspirators, but
keeps all the design in his own breast.</p>

<p>In short the ship struck several times and
bulg’d. The captain and his men all got
ashore: he says one was lost; but it is utterly
false: and how wretched so ever he has painted
their lives and conversation, the reader
will but little regard what he writes: for it
is certain he saved all that was most valuable;
particularly sugar and powder, both
which are damaged as soon any thing. He
sav’d but little provision; because that is
always stow’d in the hold: but he rememberd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
to get out his commission, with all
the plate and money. What else could he
expect? He used to say it was easy living at
<i>Fernandes</i>, but now ’tis to serve another
turn, he says quite other things.</p>

<p>Here they put themselves under the <i>Jamaica</i>
discipline; and divided among them
every shilling of the money laid by before
for the Owners, and all our shares left in
the ships by us who were taken prisoners:
and the only reason <i>Shelvocke</i> gives for this,
is the old story, his men would have it so:
but I that have most reason of any man living
to know him best, shall prove that <i>Shelvocke</i>
lost not a tittle of his command after
the shipwreck: for after they had put themselves
on the model aforesaid, whereby he
says the captains are allow’d but four shares;
he could manage it so, as to have six. And
whatever hardships he may sham the reader
with, p. 223, those six proportions are much
better now, than sixty before. For pray
consider, the gentlemen Owners are intirely
excluded; who were to have one half
of all the capture; and then he has got rid
of more than half his ship’s company, among
whom <i>Hatley</i>, as second captain, was intituled
to thirty shares; my self to twenty,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the two mates, the surgeon’s mate, the ensign,
a serjeant and corporal of marines, besides
the foremastmen. All these shares, I
say, being deducted, besides reducing three
more of his chief officers, <i>La Port</i>, <i>Hendrie</i>
and <i>Dod</i>, two of which afterwards quitted
the ship, does not all this make it evident,
that six shares, where there are but 52 dividends
of the whole capture are better than
60 where there are 650 dividends of half
the capture? This shews how greatly <i>Shelvocke</i>
would impose upon mankind, and is
a confirmation that it was his aim and his
interest to destroy the ship; and bring about
this new regulation.</p>

<p>As to the whole trifling account of his
transactions at <i>Fernandes</i> taking up above
fifty pages of his book, as it is little to me;
I shall take but little notice of it: leaving
the reader to amuse himself with it at leisure.
He has taken pains all along to make us believe,
that the shipwreck was not his own
act and deed, by representing the hardships
he was exposed to ashore, from the dissention
of his people, the barreness of the
place, and the improbability of his getting
well to sea again: But this is all artifice, to
make the reader imagine, that no man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
would run himself voluntarily into so many
difficulties. It is certain they liv’d poor
enough upon the island; but having good
carpenters, caulkers, smiths, and all proper
workmen, he continually imploy’d them
upon the main point: which was to get a
new bark built out of the old ship; in
order to make a private fortune in a more
expeditious manner, than he could before:
as I shall demonstrate by and by, when I
shew my reader the written account of
their acquisition, and how they shard it on
the coast of <i>Mexico</i>; tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> has
conceal’d it. One thing I must not forget,
p. 225, he says that Mr. <i>Brook</i> having got
the love of the people; was named to be
their future commander: but as it did not
take place, I shall shew how <i>Shelvocke</i> took
care it never should, by making away with
him and five more at <i>Sansonate</i>.</p>

<p>However, I must not quit him without
a story I lately had from Mr. <i>Hendrie</i>, which
shews how he was divested of his authority,
as he calls it, p. 219. Captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
maintaind as absolute sway at <i>Fernandes</i>,
as before, till the tenth of <i>June</i> came
about. The men knowing what affection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the captain had for that anniversary, some
of them begd to have the small arms to
celebrate the day in the most dutiful manner
they could: upon which <i>Shelvocke</i> readily
consented; and those who did not care
to assist at it, diverted themselves about the
island, not knowing but a civil war might
be the consequence. So, a bonfire was
made steeple high, the loyal subjects wearing
artificial roses of linen rags and paper,
while several cordial vollies and huzzas were
let off; <i>Shelvocke</i> himself being captain of
the mob, and his son <i>George</i> the skinker to
fill out the liquor. But, what sower’d the
festival was, they had nothing to drink the
<i>Chevalier</i>’s health in, but vinegre, water
and sugar, being the best punch they could
get. At the close of this rejoycing, the captain
demanded their muskets; but the men
were wise enough to keep them, the scheme
having been chiefly laid for that purpose.</p>

<p>In short, on the fifth of <i>October 1720</i>,
the bark is completed, launched, and calld
the <i>Recovery</i>. And thus by giving her a
new name, captain <i>Shelvocke</i> has the new
fashiond assurance to tell mankind that
the Owners title is quite sunk, as if there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
never had been any such thing: tho’ he still
proceded with the king’s commission, being
the property of the Owners; and is the
same which he afterwards producd at <i>China</i>,
as a protection for his own person, and
a security for all that he had rapaciously
got together.</p>

<p>And whereas, p. 216, he affectedly says,
that the men in a body thank’d him for
giving them a prospect of deliverance; I
think it very improbable that the men would
be so courtly, when above twenty of them
chose to remain upon the island. And
whereas again, p. 242, he insinuates that
they who stay’d behind were afraid to venture
in the new bark; I think it much more
natural to suppose, they had rather stay upon
that island and trust to the mercies of
providence, than be made the certain tools
of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s tyranny and self interest.</p>

<p>My captain’s first enterprize was with the
<i>Margarita</i>, p. 262, he calls her a forty gun
ship; which at that rate could not burthen
less than 400 ton. In this I can confront
him of my own authority: for I was aboard
this ship afterwards at <i>Callao</i>, and she never
carried above 200 ton and eighteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
guns: but <i>Shelvocke</i> wisely magnifys her
force, because her geting clear might bring
no other slur upon his captainship: whereas
she certainly escaped thro’ his own fear:
for after his gunner was kill’d he took the
helm in his hand from <i>Christopher Hawkins</i>,
and puting it hard down, sheer’d off
from her. P. 279, he says, he heard the
captain and three of the <i>Margarita</i>’s men
were killd in the action; which is so far
from truth, that they had none kill’d, and
only a <i>Nigro</i> wounded in the cheek. They
had not above a dozen cartridges of powder
aboard, and two or three small arms belonging
to the passengers, with only stones or
ballast for shot. The commander of her
was a <i>Frenchman</i>, who told it me all at
<i>Callao</i>: beside which, captain <i>Opie</i> in the
<i>Carteret</i> brought from <i>Buenos Aires</i> one
of the <i>Margarita</i>’s passengers, who told
the story to fifty gentlemen about town.</p>

<p><i>David Griffith</i>, who went with <i>Shelvocke</i>
to <i>China</i>, confirms all the above particulars.
He has been with me since his arrival
in <i>London</i>, and says that captain <i>Morel</i>,
who was afterwards taken aboard the <i>Conception</i>,
declared there was a man in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
<i>Margarita</i>, who stood ready by the colours
immediately to strike, if captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
could have taken courage to board her.
<i>David</i> further assures me, that <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
whole account of that story is to excuse his
own faint heart: for whereas he talks of
his animating the men, and their backwardness
to fight, it is a mean pitiful forgery;
for the men were unanimous for boarding
the enemy; and <i>Shelvocke</i> shamefully refused
it; took the helm and sheerd off.</p>

<p>His next feat is plundering the village
of <i>Iquique</i>; where he got a good quantity
of provision, wine and brandy: immediately
after which he meets with and attacks
the <i>Francisco Palacio</i> a large merchant
ship: and <i>Shelvocke</i> by this time being
somewhat potvaliant, I believe he did his
indeavour to carry her; but she provd too
big for his bark. However his main purpose
being to change his new baptized vessel,
as soon as he could, he quickly met
with an opportunity that succeded. Standing
into the road of <i>Pisco</i>, they discover a
good ship: whereupon <i>Shelvocke</i> summons
his people, who came to a resolution to
board her at once; which they luckily performd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
without resistance. This prize was
calld <i>Jesu Maria</i> of 200 ton, laden with
pitch, tar and copper: so that our freebooters
decently quit their slight new tenement
for a good, clean, weatherproof habitation.
It seems the <i>Spaniard</i> offerd 16000
dollars for her again: but <i>Shelvocke</i>’s people
were certainly in the right to keep
the prize; for considering their circumstance,
no money at that time could be an
equivalent.</p>

<p>A way he sails to <i>Payta</i> in the <i>Jesu Maria</i>,
where the most important thing I find,
is the reflexion he makes upon the conduct of
captain <i>Clipperton</i>, who he says refused
a booty of 400,000 dollars, king’s money,
which lay there in the governer’s hands.</p>

<p>Here <i>Shelvocke</i> gives another great example
of his ignorance; for to my experience,
who was first set there ashore, after
being a prisoner; I know very well that
the place is poor and without a governer,
having no trade whereby any duties, worth
mentioning, can arise to his <i>Catholic</i> Majesty:
There is indeed a head man (as
there is in all places) called <i>Teniente</i>, who
makes a hard shift to live by exacting port
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
charges and other small fees from the vessels
that touch there only for refreshments,
and to put their pedlars ashore. <i>Clipperton</i>
knew this very well, and was too prudent
to make a fresh broil upon the coast
for nothing at all, and that’s the reason he
never touchd there; tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> has
magnified himself so much upon it, and
has absurdly connected two facts together,
which happend at a year’s distance: For
the first time the <i>Success</i> was in the parallel
of <i>Payta</i>, was <i>Nov. 1719</i>; and the
second time <i>Nov. 1720</i>, as appears plainly
by <i>Taylor</i>’s journal: and yet this ignorant
book-writer, p. 188 and 288, has mention’d
<i>Clipperton</i>’s puting prisoners ashore there in
<i>Nov. 1719</i>, being the first time: whereas
the prisoners he designd to put ashore was
in <i>Nov. 1720</i>, a twelve month afterwards;
which however he did not; but landed
them at <i>Cape Helen</i>; as specifyd in the
journal the 2d. section of this voyage. He is
very right to assert that which no one can
doubt of, when he says <i>Clipperton</i> might
have taken <i>Payta</i> as easily as he did; and
so might any vessel, sending ashore six armed
men, for there’s no such thing as firearms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
being a naked village of defenceless
<i>Indians</i>. But it is endless for me to set
the public right in every fact of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
history; for as the whole is divided into
voluntary falshood and plain ignorance, his
book may more justly be calld a romantic
libel than a journal.</p>

<p>His next arrival is at the island of <i>Quibo</i>, p.
303; where he talks of a terrible sort of
hogs with their navels upon their backs; for
my part I don’t easily believe such out of
the way things; but refer our captain <i>Quibo</i>
to dispute it with the physicians and anatomists.</p>

<p>In their passage hither he says his men
frequently got drunk and quareld; and
that he went in danger of his life, and
used to have his clothes tore from his back,
if he endeavourd to part them. This too
may be a very important discovery to the
rest of his readers; but I my self know him
so well that it is no news to me: for <i>Shelvocke</i>
used to make freer with the wine and
brandy than any one; and I believe his
men thought it no harm to follow his example
and drink their skins full, especially
since their new establishment was more like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
a commonwealth than an absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>During these useful discoveries of our
author, I think ’tis pity any thing should
interrupt him; but as the devil would have
it, <i>Jan. 1721</i>, he meets captain <i>Clipperton</i>
in the <i>Success</i>, which interview he says was
very astonishing: And truly I believe it was:
<i>Clipperton</i> might well be surprized at the
history of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s management; and
<i>Shelvocke</i> had as great reason to wonder
the other did not confine him for it: And
I can tell him the gentlemen here at home
wondered at it, and took it ill that he did
not. But what astonishes me most, is that
<i>Shelvocke</i> has the hardiness to give us the
history of captain <i>Mitchel</i>, for the truth of
which he appeals to a dead man, Mr. <i>Davison</i>,
who told him so; which <i>Davison</i> was
killd at <i>Guam</i> before <i>Shelvocke</i> came to
<i>China</i>. The tragical circumstances, as he
calls them, p. 309, of a jealousy between
<i>Clipperton</i> and <i>Mitchel</i>; of the later’s being
orderd with a rich cargo to a place no
where to be found, and yet orderd thither
on purpose to be destroyd, are reflexions so
malicious, and yet so irrational, that <i>Shelvocke</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
must be fuddled when he writ them.</p>

<p>The journal tells us how he was fitted out,
and whither bound; that his cargo was ten
thousand pound value: is it possible then,
supposing a real misunderstanding, that <i>Clipperton</i>
would pay so dear to get rid of the
gentleman? ’Tis certain he never imbarked
his men in lighters or in empty prizes with
any design to make away with them, as
<i>Shelvocke</i> served us: captain <i>Mitchel</i> was
put aboard a clean ship, well mand, and
provided with stores and necessaries, and a
valuable parcel of goods to dispose of at
<i>Brasil</i> for the Owners advantage in order
to secure them something: and it is true
that neither he nor the twenty three men
with him were ever yet heard of: But how
is <i>Clipperton</i> chargeable with that? or what
excuse can <i>Shelvocke</i> make for these impious
reflexions, but a sort of pleasure he
has in being revenged on the memory of
the dead. Thus far <i>Mitchel</i> may be accounted
for: The journal <i>March</i> 16th. 1720. tells
us that being obliged to wood and water, he
touched to the northward, at port <i>Velas</i>;
where it’s very probable he and his men became
a prey to the enemy: for the said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
article mentions that several of <i>Clipperton</i>’s
men saw some shirts and other things worn
by the natives, which by the mark convinced
them <i>Mitchel</i> had been there. <i>Shelvocke</i>
goes on in this childish manner, p. 308.
talking of submersions of islands, and that
it was conjectured <i>Mitchel</i> and his men, the
ship, the island and all were sunk under
water: This likewise he says was Mr. <i>Davison</i>’s
opinion; who I know had more sense
than to say or think any such silly thing.
He says farther that <i>Clipperton</i> never cleand
his ship, whereas the journal takes notice
of his having done it two or three times;
besides several others omitted by me, as
not for my design to transcribe every such
trifling remark. As for <i>Clipperton</i>’s behaviour
at <i>Conception</i>, <i>Coquimbo</i>, and afterwards
at <i>Guam</i> it was ill judged no doubt:
and tho’ it was so, I have impartially enterd
it in my second section, it being
much more for my purpose to tell the
truth, than to stifle it: But let it be as it
will; he certainly had the Owners interest
in view, and thought honesty the best policy;
though captain <i>Shelvocke</i> has taken leave
to think otherwise. On the next leaf he says,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
that upon meeting the <i>Success</i> he expected
to be treated by them as one belonging to
the same interest; but found himself mistaken.
Truly there’s nothing strange in
that; for his was a private interest, and
theirs a public one. Besides, the journal
says, that he would not come into terms:
which is answer enough to all his complaints
of unkindness, treachery, and so forth.</p>

<p>After meeting with the <i>Success</i> several
times in the <i>South Seas</i>, I come now to
the last time of their meeting, which was
in <i>March 1721.</i> off of <i>Acapulco</i>; whereas the
journal mentions, it was thought most adviseable
to joyn both companies, and attempt
the great <i>Manilla</i> ship. As to the
remarks that <i>Shelvocke</i> has made upon this
transaction, and the pains he has taken to
represent <i>Clipperton</i> a monstrous creature,
’tis not to be minded. The journal says,
the proposal to <i>Shelvocke</i> was this, That if
he and his crew would refund all the money
shared among themselves contrary to the
Owners articles, and put it in a joint stock;
then all faults should be forgot, both companies
would unite and procede to cruise
for the <i>Acapulco</i> ship: The very next article
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
in the journal is, that not hearing from
captain <i>Shelvocke</i>, and the time for the <i>Acapulco</i>
ship setting out for <i>Manilla</i>, being
several days past; Resolved in council to
make our best dispatch for <i>East India</i>. Here
is the plain true account of the affair, and
how the treaty broke off: but <i>Shelvocke</i>
has labourd hard to pervert the truth of
this fact, as he has done all the rest, thinking
to gain pity from mankind, by telling
what he sufferd through the deceit of <i>Clipperton</i>,
never expecting that these things
would be refuted and clear’d up. Besides,
there may be other reasons assignd for
<i>Clipperton</i>’s sudden separation, tho’ not
enterd in the journal: for he knew, before
he left <i>England</i>, that the <i>Spanish</i> fleet
was all taken and destroyd by admiral <i>Byng</i>;
and therefore a peace was probably concluded,
being two years past: and therefore Shelvocke,
who had not made his fortune while
the war lasted, and had really ruind the
project, ought of the two to be the sufferer.
’Tis very likely, <i>Clipperton</i> for these reasons
did not care to imbarrass his ship just upon
the point of his leaving the <i>South-Sea</i>; but
on second thoughts, concluded it was better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
to keep what he had got. These, I say,
are very fair conjectures: but the reason
mentiond in the journal above is sufficient
of it self; for <i>Shelvocke</i> thought the conditions
proposed by <i>Clipperton</i> were too
strict: He did not care to refund what he
had unlawfully shared, which doubtless he
ought to have done; and for the neglect of
which, ’tis evident the whole affair ended.</p>

<p>P. 321, <i>Shelvocke</i> talks of articles which
he demanded of <i>Clipperton</i> and <i>Godfrey</i>:
That in case they took this rich prize, he
and his people should be intitled to their
proper shares, according to their first agreement
with the Owners: This in my humble
opinion is a great weakness in <i>Shelvocke</i>
to publish, tho’ he passes for a cunning
fellow: for why should he insist upon
a repetition or confirmation of the first articles
with the gentlemen Owners, if he
was not conscious of his having, some how
or other, forfeited his right by a notorious
mismanagement and breach of trust?</p>

<p>P. 327. He concludes this long invective
with a smart reflexion upon <i>Clipperton</i>, that
it was his fear to ingage the <i>Manilla</i> ship,
which made him recede from the proposal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
For my part, I really think he had reason
to fear it, having twice narrowly escaped
the men of war already: and since <i>Shelvocke</i>
refused to put his plunder money in
the common stock, why should <i>Clipperton</i>
risk all he had, to mend another man’s
fortune? <i>Shelvocke</i> most certainly would
have been glad of so great an addition to
his capture, as the <i>Acapulco</i> ship must have
afforded; and I doubt not he would have
run away with a very handsome share of it,
as he has done with all he took both before
and after: and now he is bitterly vext
with <i>Clipperton</i>, because the bite did not
take.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i>’s next exploit is at <i>Sansonate</i>;
where finding a ship at anchor call’d the
<i>Holy Family</i> he attacks her, and after some
resistance takes her: She proved no great
prize: but being a better sailer, he thought
fit to shift the cargo of the <i>Jesu Maria</i>,
and change ships with the <i>Spaniard</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> says p. 331, that this ship was
fitted out and commission’d on purpose to
take him; and would have us believe he
has performed wonders in the ingagement.
I own I am at a loss to account for this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
man’s extravagant assurance, when he and I,
and every body knows the viceroy never
grants commissions to merchantmen. There
were three men of war out already; and
had this been a commission ship, there would
have been officers and sailors aboard making
a regular force of 150 men at least; who
would never have submitted, especially in
the condition they found <i>Shelvocke</i>. He
owns himself it was a merchantman, and
yet stupidly says they were commission’d to
take him.</p>

<p>Just as he was going to sea, he receives
a letter from the governer with notice
that there was a truce between <i>England</i>
and <i>Spain</i>; wherein he demanded restitution
of the ship and cargo; on refusal of
which he should be declared a pyrate. Tho’
<i>Shelvocke</i> did not depend upon this for
truth; yet being greatly reduced and wanting
all necessaries of life, he was willing in
some measure to treat about it. He sends
ashore lieutenant <i>Brook</i> his next officer with
five men under a flag of truce; who were
immediately made prisoners.</p>

<p>Thus he gets rid of six more of his people,
under the show of a treaty with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
governer, for they were never since heard
of. I don’t expect the world will judge of
this affair as I do, because those who are
ignorant of the circumstances of these things,
and unacquainted with <i>Shelvocke</i>’s personal
behaviour, cannot make a proper censure.
When a man dies in a course of physic,
who knows whether ’tis chance, or design
in the doctor? the patient is gone by legal
prescription. So here a gentleman is fairly
orderd ashore into an enemy’s hand: and
if he never returns, who can say it is a design
or accident? Thus much is certain,
they went without a hostage, tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i>
always had strong notions of the <i>Spaniards</i>
resentment, and their manner of revenge;
especially in <i>Mexico</i>, where the
<i>Indians</i> are the cruelest people alive. And
while he was speaking of <i>Mitchel</i>’s story,
we find him quick enough to leave it past
doubt, that he and his men perishd in some
obscure manner: and yet he must now send
a young gentleman ashore into the clutches
of this enemy, at a time when he knew
the whole coast was exasperated, and himself
destitute of all common necessaries; with
a very indifferent force, and consequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
not able to resent any affront, much less
to avenge himself on the governer, in case
he detaind <i>Brook</i> and his men. <i>Shelvocke</i>
immediately before and after this acted in
a hostile manner on that coast; and even
in their view he took this ship called the
<i>Holy Family</i>, where the countermaster lost
his life: so that if poor <i>Brook</i> and his men
were sacrific’d by way of atonement, ’tis no
severe supposition. For my own part, I
know he hated <i>Brook</i>, for adhering to the
constitution of his country; and because
he could not digest the jacobite healths, that
<i>Shelvocke</i> usd to drink: I have observed before,
how he abused him for discovering
<i>Clipperton</i>’s name on the tree, when we first
touchd at <i>Fernandes</i>; and <i>Shelvocke</i> himself
explains the jealousy he had of him,
when they were there the second time: all
which being considerd, I leave those to
make inferences, who have been long in
the world, and studyd mankind.</p>

<p>There’s another gentleman this author
has made free with, <i>Randal</i> by name, <i>Brook</i>’s
brother in law, who having gone round the
world with <i>Shelvocke</i> was arrested by the
Owners at his landing, as were several others,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and secured in the King’s bench prison,
where he died. This lieutenant <i>Randal</i>
has not escaped the malice of his pen;
but in many places of the book, is very ill
treated. And I cannot help observing that
a great part of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s voyage
is libelling the dead: such as <i>Clipperton</i>,
<i>Davison</i>, <i>Randal</i>, and others. This way of
accusing is infamous, and abhorrd by all
civilized nations; which I hope is some excuse,
for my appearing in their defense:
and tho’ I can but poorly perform the office,
yet what I do offer, is founded upon
certain knowledge and truth.</p>

<p>Before I leave this prize calld the <i>Holy
Family</i>, I must inform the reader, that <i>Shelvocke</i>,
far from having any merit in taking
her, ought to have lost the command of his
own ship for deserting his post upon the
quarter deck. After two or three of his
men were wounded, <i>Shelvocke</i> expecting
warm work, sculkd with his son behind the
boat which lay upon the main deck; and
left <i>David Griffith</i> alone to ply the gun
upon quarter deck: for which desertion,
<i>Griffith</i> ought in justice to have succeded
as captain of the ship. Moreover, whenever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
<i>Shelvocke</i> ventured from the said barricade
and judged a shot was coming, he would
skilfully plant himself behind the main mast,
leaving <i>David</i> by himself to fight the <i>Philistines</i>.
But to return.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> unable to get provision at <i>Sansonate</i>,
retires with fresh apprehensions
that he must be forced to surrender whether
peace or war; and chose therefore to
go to <i>Panama</i>, where he hoped for tolerable
usage, there being an <i>English</i> factory:
And what excuse can he invent for not
going there before the loss of these six men?
Conscious of his guilt, he frames a long
protest against the governer’s procedings,
which doubtless is a thing all invented since,
and no original. Accordingly he steers away
for the gulf of <i>Amapala</i>, where among
the islands he hoped for a recruit of water;
but found none: and being now indeed in
a deplorable condition, forced to drink the
sea water or their own urine; they agree,
weak as they are, to bear away again for
<i>Quibo</i> to get water. In their way to this
place, they providentially met with a small
supply at the isle of <i>Cano</i>, with the apparent
hazard of <i>Randal</i>’s life. For <i>Shelvocke</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
tho’ he was so liberal with the lives of other
men, took care of his son, tall boy
<i>George</i>, and his minion <i>Stewart</i>, keeping
them safe aboard; and never orderd either
of them ashore when there was any appearance
of danger; nor is there one instance
of it in all his book. At last with miserable
difficulties they reach <i>Quibo</i>, where
they wood and water at leisure; thinking
however still to surrender at <i>Panama</i>, if
fortune did not throw some agreeable prize
in their way, which happend very soon:
For a few days after they left <i>Quibo</i>, a
small bark laden with beef and pork fell
accidentally into their hands, taking them
for <i>Spaniards</i>: Tho’ she proved a lucky
prize to <i>Shelvocke</i>, at a time when his people
were near starving, and had not provision
enough to hold them to <i>China</i>, yet he tells us
p. 266, that they were all so tired of the
sea, and past hopes of making a considerable
dividend of money, that they chose rather
to go ashore at any rate and surrender.</p>

<p>While things were in this doubtful state,
and nothing material happend for three
days; but it was really expected a period
must be put to <i>Shelvocke</i>’s privatiering, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
sail presented her self standing along shore
to <i>Panama</i>, which he immediately gave
chase to, leaving the bark which he had in
tow, with four of his men and five <i>Nigros</i>
to take care of her. He made all the
sail he could ’till night, when fearing the
chafe would give him the slip, he advised, as
he says, bringing to, that the bark might
come up again; but having otherwise resolved,
they continued their sail all night.
Early the next morning, being the 20th of
<i>May</i>, he came up with the chase, and after
a small dispute carryd her. I must not omit
that when they returnd to the bark, they
found her quite deserted, and the decks coverd
with blood: so that he has now four
more of his men destroyd, and leaves it past
question that they were murderd. After
which he would patch the story up with an
idle supposition, that the <i>Spanish</i> crew he
left in the bark all jumpd into the sea and
drownd themselves: Is it not as easy to
imagine they saw a boat coming by before
they acted the murder? or if not, ’tis common
for the natives of that part of the
world to swim several leagues. All people
naturally secure their method of escape before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
they commit a violence of this nature:
and I am sure ’tis a more rational conjecture,
than to think they would destroy
the <i>English</i> first, and murder themselves afterwards.
<i>Shelvocke</i> crys out it was a cruel
return for his civilities, having lent them
these four men to assist them, p. 374. Sure
this cannot be captain <i>Shelvocke</i> himself,
but his son <i>Georgy</i> who talks of sending
men aboard a prize out of civility. This
is such a sort of complaisance, as when an
officer takes the defendents goods in execution,
and out of pure good nature sends
a man into the house to keep possession.
Such stuff as this is worth reading for the
great rarity of it; but who would ever
expect to meet with it in a book calld A
voyage round the world. He goes on and
says, “It seemd strange to me, that our
men should suffer themselves or run the
least hazard of exposing themselves to be
thus butcherd.” Indeed, captain, I believe
they could not help it; otherwise it
would have been somewhat strange: and
I am apt to fancy no man alive can help
it when he is overpowerd. But what sort
of language is this, “to run the least hazard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
of exposing themselves to be thus
butcherd?” Did you ever hear of peoples
voluntary exposing themselves to have
their throats cut? Did not he hazard and
expose the men who left them there without
an officer? <i>Shelvocke</i>’s reason why this
seemd strange is as good as the rest; for
says he, they were four in number! a
mighty number indeed against a ship’s crew.
He owns they were five <i>Spaniards</i>, and there
might be ten for any thing we know: it
was certainly for his purpose to lessen the
number: and why might not the five <i>Nigros</i>
joyn in the massacre upon certain views
and promises? I have as much reason to suppose
the one as the other. But the whole story
is such a piece of dull thinking and poor language,
that ’tis time I have done with it.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">THIS</em> being the great crisis of captain
<i>Shelvocke</i>’s voyage, I shall be more particular
in relating the affair of this last prize,
which will open the most notorious scene
of villany and deceit that has appeard yet,
p. 371. The ship was called the <i>Conception</i>,
<i>Don Stephen de Recova</i> commander bound
from <i>Callao</i> to <i>Panama</i> having on board
several persons of distinction, particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the <i>Conde de la Rosa</i> a <i>Spanish</i> nobleman
who had been sometime governer of <i>Pisco</i>
and was now going home to <i>Spain</i>: “laden
with flower, sugar, marmalade, peaches,
grapes, limes, <i>etcætera</i>.” Now, <i>Be it known
to</i> <em class="gesperrt"><small>ALL MEN</small></em>, <i>That, that</i> et cætera <i>was A
hundred and eight thousand six hundred and
thirty six pieces of eight</i>: and <i>Shelvocke</i>
little thought when he took this prize or
compiled his book, that I of all men should
have this exact state of the affair. He often
said, he would never give the gentlemen
Owners a fair account; and I have often
promised in this treatise to prove that he
did say so; and now we have both made
our words good. I have not only an authentic
account; but I’ll declare also how I
got it. When I was taken and carried prisoner
to <i>Lima</i>, I had leisure enough to reflect
on my misfortunes: how likely I was
to be ruind, and the Owners to be cheated.
So that to prepare them in defense of their
rights, I wrote over to one of them the
substance of what had occurrd to me: how
<i>Shelvocke</i> had mismanaged; how arbitrarily
he had acted in defiance of their articles,
and what his private intentions were in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
future part of the voyage. As soon as I
came to <i>London</i>, which was in <i>October 1721</i>,
I confirmd the purport of my letter with several
new circumstances. For all which performance
of my duty, I do suppose my name
has met with so much accusation and reproach
in captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s book. But beside
my advices, the gentlemen had many
proofs from other prisoners and other people.
Eleven months after, being <i>August</i>, captain
<i>Shelvocke</i> himself arrived, and waits immediately
on the said gentleman to compound
in the lump for all his transactions;
not owning any thing of this prize, which
he had unlawfully shared, and every thing
else among three and thirty of them. Instead
of compromising the matter, the gentleman
read him my letter, secured him,
and the same day had him confined in <i>Wood-street</i>
counter. A few days after his pupil
<i>Stewart</i> arrives at <i>Dover</i>, and was seized
by the honest warden of the castle according
to directions; who faithfully secured his book
of accounts and brought it with the prisoner
to the Owners, from whom I had the
book and copyd the dividend, which is as
follows.

<p>Here the reader perceives the sum total
of this dividend to be short of what I said
the capture amounted to: but in order to
set that matter right, there is a secret article
of 627 quadruples of gold, which <i>Shelvocke</i>
graciously shared among private friends;
each of which quadruple or double doubloon
is worth sixteen dollars or pieces of
eight,</p>

<p>All which money <i>Shelvocke</i> has the prodigious
modesty to conceal; and only says
the prize was laden with flower, sugar, fruit,
<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Stewart</i>’s book mentions the 627
doubloons, but not a word how they were
divided. So that we must imagine them
to be sunk among both the <i>Shelvockes</i> and
<i>Stewart</i>: perhaps <i>Adams</i> came in for a little.
For as <i>Stewart</i> was agent, cashier and
paymaster, it was an easy matter to hide a
bag of gold from the public, and dispose
of it afterwards in a committee of two or
three.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>When <i>Shelvocke</i> orderd me upon that
expedition in the lighter, as I gave my
fortune over for lost, so I judged my person
to be in a very precarious condition:
and thinking my money safer in the <i>Speedwel</i>,
I deliverd it to Mr. <i>Hendrie</i> the former
agent, being about 350 dollars: for I
little dreamd of the scheme that <i>Shelvocke</i>
had formd, to lose the ship and seize all
for himself; but that if my money came to
<i>England</i> I should have it some time or
other. However, all these effects were shared
at <i>Fernandes</i>, as aforementioned. So among
other things I left a wig with <i>John Theobald</i>
the barber on the list, who sold it afterwards
to <i>Coldsea</i> the master for ten dollars:
but as soon as <i>Theobald</i> found me out
in <i>London</i>, he honestly came and paid me
the money, and told me his share of this
prize was as it stands in the account: but
he knew nothing of the second dividend.</p>

<p>By the above account it’s plain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
dividend of the silver taken in the <i>Conception
de Recova</i> came to 2642 l. 10 s. of
which he afterwards made thirty <i>per cent.</i>
in <i>China</i>, reckoning at a medium; for sometimes
it is there at forty, but never under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
twenty five. The gold he doubtless brought
home, being there less than value. He
sold the ship for about 650 pound; but says,
p. 457. he paid twice that sum for port
charges: and therefore I don’t place it to
account; tho’ I know very well he had wit
enough to make all his people contribute.
And, as there is no minding what he says, it
was certainly for his purpose when he writ
the book, to lessen that money he sold
his ship for, and to swell the sum he paid
for anchorage. For why should he pay
2166 pound port charges, and <i>Clipperton</i>
but 396, as <i>Taylor</i>’s journal mentions, when
we all know <i>Shelvocke</i>’s was but a merchant
ship, and <i>Clipperton</i>’s a warlike ship, carrying
forty guns and above three times the number
of hands! This great disparity, and the
reason I just now mentiond, makes my captain
strongly suspected: but however, as I
am not certain, I shall reckon nothing for it.
Add to this the amount of the St. <i>Fermin</i>
and other prizes taken on the coast of <i>Chili</i>,
which was at least 2000 pound, all shared as
before, tho’ not set down. Then lastly,
the ship’s cargo is unaccounted for, which
he gently slips over, and forgets he ownd,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
p. 313, it was a valuable one. This is intirely
his own perquisit and pocket-money;
for as no soul but himself can now tell what
that value was, or what he made of it: I
can only remain an unhappy, ignorant, injured
sufferer; and wonder that so much
baseness and treachery can appear, and yet
live unpunisht.</p>

<p>From all which particulars it is evident
captain <i>Shelvocke</i> has secured to himself and
brought to <i>England</i> a great sum of money,
being neither his merit, nor his due: and
tho’ he is probably possest of much more
than we can make out, yet even <i>Stewart</i>
himself assured me, that <i>Shelvocke</i> could not
be less than seven thousand pound gainer
by the voyage.</p>

<p>P. 371, he says this was the second of
those warlike merchant ships that was fitted
out in an extraordinary manner and commissiond
to take him. This is another instance
of his vain-glory and absurdity, and is
sufficiently answerd by referring to what I
said about the other ship calld <i>The Holy
Family</i>, which he also said was commissiond
to take him. But how particularly
silly it appears in this case, let any one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
judge that reads it. Can it be believed or
imagined that the <i>Conde de la Rosa</i>, whose
property this money chiefly was, would venture
so great a sum aboard a ship that was
commissiond to take a privatier? I never
heard, nor the oldest man alive, that a ship
fitted out for warlike enterprize, was stored
with money instead of ammunition. Suppose
two or three honest fellows were
equipt to take a highwayman that had long
infested the roads and plagued the country;
can any one believe they would furnish their
pockets with half crowns instead of a pair
of pistols? Sure <i>Shelvocke</i> must take his
reader for an <i>Ignoramus</i>; and having lost
all morals himself, thinks other people have
lost their senses.</p>

<p>After this, I think, I need not be very
studious to prove captain <i>Shelvocke</i> a sad fellow.
I have hitherto labourd diligently;
but now I believe his and my readers will
come easily on my side. This fact is too
flagrant to be denyd: ’tis self-evident and
known to every body. All the anteceding
circumstances of his voyage are mean dishonest
actions, tending to this one perfidious
end: and whoever reads his preface after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
seeing this account, must read it with indignation.
What pretense has he there to
talk of reputation, truth and integrity? P.
31, he councils all those who may hereafter
subscribe for another cruising expedition,
to regulate well their articles; and look out
for a commander of strict <i>honour</i> and <i>honesty</i>:
which advice from captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
can be of no other use, than that it certainly
excludes him for life. And how black
soever he appears, he may thank himself:
for tho’ his transactions were never so foul
and unjust, I should perhaps have lived and
died a private sufferer; and not given my
self the excessive trouble of being public
defendent, had not <i>Shelvocke</i> turnd public
author, and added folly to his villainy, by
putting it in print. But it’s high time to
disabuse mankind, when an author not
content with doing private injuries, shall
print and publish whatever his wicked heart
can invent, and thus indeavour to make
his poison universal.</p>

<p>P. 378, he says, “he took out of the
<i>Conception</i> twelve months provision of
bread, flower, sugar and sweatmeats; with
a like proportion for the <i>Success</i>, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
he expected to find at <i>Tres Marias</i>, being
then a stranger to <i>Clipperton</i>’s faithless
desertion.” Not to mention the falshood
of his expecting to meet <i>Clipperton</i>, who
never promised to meet him, ’tis a piece of
barefaced hypocrisy to say he put up any provision
for the <i>Success</i>. <i>Shelvocke</i> knew better
what to do with his money and time,
than to venture the loss of both to look for
a man whom he always shund and hated for
having the chief command: besides he speaks
immediately of going to <i>Asia</i>; for being
well supplyd with money and necessaries,
their thoughts of surrendering were laid aside,
and all their despair vanishd. He
twice calls it a hazardous experiment going
over to <i>Asia</i>; and gives us some trifling
reasons, but the others he says he will keep
a secret, being needless there to mention,
p. 380: one of which I have lately unfolded
for him; which was really a fear lest
he and all his money should be seized at
<i>China</i>.</p>

<p>Any one acquainted with the story may
discover all his thin disguises, and easily perceive
that every word he says from p. 381
to 385 makes plainly against him. He talks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of cakes of virgin silver found in the prize,
moulded into marmalade boxes to defraud
the king of <i>Spain</i> of his fifths; while he, at
the same time, appears much more guilty to
defraud the gentlemen Owners, and us prisoners,
and imposing now this notorious
sham upon his disinterested readers. Does
so much fruit, marmalade and passengers
aboard, prove that the ship was commissiond
to take him? or why does <i>Shelvocke</i>
talk so much of sweatmeats, except
the money run in his head. Twenty five
thousand pounds and upwards, besides rich
plunder, is a fine box of marmalade truly.</p>

<p>P. 382. He fairly says every thing taken
out of the <i>Conception</i> was divided according
to the new articles made at <i>Fernandes</i>;
which I believe to be mighty true, because
it is the genuine account which I copyd
from his own steward’s book; tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i>
then little thought that <i>Betagh</i> would have
it here to produce against him. He complains
he had no more than six shares. I
have proved already at the beginning of
this section, that six, according to his last
arbitrary scheme, are much better than sixty
by the first articles with the Owners. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
how in the name of sense could <i>Shelvocke</i>
expect sixty out of two and fifty? for it’s
plain by the account there are no more.
Thou art a very unconscionable fellow indeed
to have more than your due, and yet
complain you have not more than all. This
is neither <i>Scotch</i>, <i>English</i>, nor <i>Irish</i>: ’Tis
the devil! and if <i>Shelvocke</i> can make sixty
out of two and fifty, he must be more
than a devil.</p>

<p>The next page or two he is very fearful
of falling into the hands of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
tho’ he talkd of nothing but surrendering
just before this prize happend. This may
look odd to a reader, who thinks he has
nothing to lose beside flower and fruit; but
after this discovery of the money it seems
natural enough to be afraid to lose it. And
why does he by way of caution speak of
a rich prize that was formerly retaken from
captain <i>Clipperton</i> by venturing too near
the shore, if the circumstances were not
similar and parallel to his own case?</p>

<p>But I need not trouble my self any longer
to expose the wretched shifts he makes to
cover his guilt. ’Tis like a schoolboy who
has been tardy and robbd an orchard: he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
first tells a lye to hide the roguery, and
then invents twenty more to patch that
up.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> having now done his business,
steers away for <i>California</i>, in order to wood
and water and clean his ship, that he might
hasten to <i>China</i> and make a good market
of his silver: for the natives there are so
fond of it, that by changing any species of
silver into gold, a man may make 30 or
40 <i>per</i> cent.</p>

<p>Accordingly in <i>August 1721</i>, he arrives
at <i>California</i>; and gives his readers a description
of the natives in the comical stile,
thinking to make amends for the rest of
his stupid incoherent romance. He would
fain give us great ideas of the good breeding
and gentility of those salvages, tho’ they
have no intercourse with any other part of
the world: but as I don’t take <i>Shelvocke</i> to
be a judge of good manners, I look upon
what he says as a fable. He has the vanity
to dwell upon that idle story of the king
of the <i>Indians</i> delivering him his sceptre,
which he says was done in a very handsome
manner; but he immediately returnd it,
and doubtless with much grace and majesty:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
and yet he says he could not tell whether
he was a king or no, only he had a black
stick in his hand; which as it was the best
thing the poor creature had, he gives it to
<i>Shelvocke</i>, expecting no doubt a spoon or
knife for it, which they are always glad of.
And <i>Shelvocke</i> will have it that this fellow
was a king, and this black stick was a sceptre;
which as he deliverd, it is pity <i>Shelvocke</i>
did not keep it, and make himself king of
the country: for it’s plain the <i>Indian</i> resignd
his sovereignty by parting with the
stick.</p>

<p>There’s none can forbear laughing who
reads his daily manner of feasting these <i>Californian</i>
gentry with vast quantities of hasty-pudding:
or his grave way of telling how
respectfully and ceremoniously they returnd
his civilities, keeping a constant equipage
for the captain and his men, whenever they
came ashore. In short, after all the country
rung of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s fame and came in daily
to view him, he concludes this ridiculous
farce by telling ye the manner of his taking
leave.</p>

<p>Page 398. When he loosed his topsails,
having a mind to appear awful, he saluted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the king and court with five guns, which
mightily frighted them: but when they
understood he was going away, the men
were sadly cast down, and the women all
fell a crying; which was a sure proof of
their being in love, tho’ <i>Shelvocke</i> is modest
and don’t own it.</p>

<p>His saying he had a mind to appear very
awful at parting, agrees well with the adoration
which he says they paid him at first reception,
p. 389: if wild ranting and frolicking
can be calld adoration.</p>

<p>His pretended natural history of <i>California</i>
is all dull and tasteless, except just that
which is taken from captain <i>Rogers</i> who was
there in 1710. <i>Shelvocke</i> p. 399. it begins
with the same words as he does p. 317. <i>Shelvocke</i>
says p. 390, “The rocks as you enter
the harbour are like the needles of the isle
of <i>Wight</i>.” <i>Rogers</i> the same words, p. 317.
The description of the men, p. 404, is
verbally the same as the other p. 314. Their
grinding a black seed which they eat for
bread, is stolen from his journal. <i>Shelvocke</i>
says their language is guttural and harsh,
p. 409. <i>Rogers</i> p. 314, word for word the
same. Their manner of living amicably and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
in common, is a transcript from the same
author. Their bows and arrows, and their
wonderful manner of diving is all the same.</p>

<p><i>Shelvocke</i> says, p. 408, A late navigator
represents the <i>Californians</i> as idle, lazy and
jealous of their women; and that he never
could have a sight of any but such as were
old. Which <i>Shelvocke</i> indeavours to be
merry upon, by saying, “he could not tell
how that gentleman treated them; but
that he himself succeded so well in his
addresses as to have them by hundreds
every day young and old.” And after
the frumety kettle had been boyling for
them all day, it’s no wonder if some of
them gave him their company all night:
for he often says they were very civil and
complaisant, and used to be concernd at
the mens taking snuff for fear it should kill
them.</p>

<p>The navigator here meant is the aforesaid
author; whose accounts being universally
commended, there’s no room to admit <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
impertinence: but after a man has
made himself so notorious a plagiary as I
have just now proved him, ’tis a very stupid
blunder in him to find fault with that only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
which signifies nothing. <i>Rogers</i> his words
are p. 316. “They appear to be very idle,
and seem to look after no more than a
present subsistence.”&mdash;This is confirmd of
all <i>Indians</i> who having no traffic, or knowledge
but what is natural, must needs be
indolent and idle: therefore I see no occasion
there was to contradict this, when he
had stole all the rest; except his ill breeding
is so natural to him, that he can’t forbear it.</p>

<p>As for his being freer with the women, I
don’t dispute that; neither is it for any man’s
honour to confute him: only I can’t help
remarking <i>Shelvocke</i>’s words at the close of
this page 408. “I may venture to say, quoth
he, that we ingaged them so far by trifling
presents and entertainments, that no body
upon those terms need want their assistance
for the future.” The plain <i>English</i>
of which is, that any man may lye with the
women for a rusty knife, or a porringer of
thick milk.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Rogers</i> has given us a handsome
concise description of the people and the
coast: and if a mariner who comes after
can make no additional discoveries, he is a
thief to print for his own another man’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
observations, and a blockhead to trouble the
world with his own schoolboy remarks;
such as his conceited notions of a king and
sceptre; he and his dirty crew having adoration
paid them, and his foolish tales of
ceremonious equipage and hasty pudding.</p>

<p>Captain <i>George Shelvocke</i> having here finish’d
his wise observations, prepares to cross
the western ocean from <i>Mexico</i> to <i>China</i>;
and with a hypocritical sigh laments the absence
of <i>Clipperton</i>, whom he partly came
hither to meet with: but says he had the
inward comfort of having added this instance
of his indeavours to the advantage of
the expedition in general, p. 433.</p>

<p>Now I leave the reader to judge whether
’tis likely he came here to seek <i>Clipperton</i>,
or was sorry for the disappointment, after
having so long shund him, blinded the
world with a false relation of his acquisition,
conceald all the money, and divided
it among three and thirty of them? and
yet this man has the calm assurance to
talk of his indeavours for the advantage
of the expedition!</p>

<p>In two or three days sail he says he discoverd
land, which he takes the liberty of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
naming <i>Shelvocke</i>’s island. Vain creature!
dost thou expect any one after reading this
narrative of your actions shall mention the
word <i>Shelvocke</i> without ridicule? much
less shall an island where you never set foot
ashore be calld after your unworthy name.
Had you been there sacrificed for your avarice
and tyranny, as <i>Peter Baldivia</i> was
at the place which bears his name, you
might ever remain, like him, unrivald in your
title; and your son <i>George</i> might have
wrote your epitaph.</p>

<p>In <i>Shelvocke</i>’s passage over to <i>Guam</i> nothing
material happens but the death of seven
or eight more of his men; some of
whose shares, I have reason to believe, became
his perquisit: for two of their widows
have assured me, that after much painful
application they could get no relief.
On his arrival at <i>Guam</i> he makes this cunning
observation, that he found it one hundred
leagues short of captain <i>Rogers</i> his account:
but I don’t wonder at that; because
this later kept a public regular journal, and
has printed each day’s run; which book
<i>Shelvocke</i> would never let his people look
into, or keep a true reckoning themselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>Page 438. Here he says he should have
been very glad of refreshments; but the ill
state of his people was an objection against
his staying, lest the governer should take
an advantage of their weakness and surprize
him. When they were upon the point
of perishing, as he calls it, one would think
it was a very proper time to get refreshments.
But this is another instance of his falsehood;
for the true reason is conceald, namely,
his fear of losing the hundred and twenty
thousand dollars, <i>&amp;c.</i> which he had aboard.</p>

<p>In <i>November</i> he gets to <i>China</i>, and meets
with some of <i>Clipperton</i>’s people at <i>Macao</i>;
from whose intelligence he gives us that
part only of <i>Clipperton</i>’s conduct which is
blameable. I own I can’t find out the pleasure
of triumphing over a dead man’s character,
especially in those private defects
which can do the defamer no service or
credit.</p>

<p>By my transcript of <i>Taylor</i>’s journal, <i>Shelvocke</i>
may see I have not omitted those facts
which related to <i>Clipperton</i>, and I am glad
to give him this proof of my impartiality:
but where he has perverted the story, I am
obliged to oppose him: for <i>Shelvocke</i> says
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
that <i>Clipperton</i> was orderd into custody at
<i>Macao</i>, for silly reasons which he gives,
and not worth my reciting, because there’s
nothing in them. If the reader please to
return to the last page or two of the journal,
he will find that <i>Clipperton</i> honestly
withstood dividing his capture as long as
he could, till an order from the <i>Mandarin</i>,
and a guard came aboard the ship to oblige
him: this <i>Shelvocke</i> has the malice to call
taking into custody; tho’ he knew the
story as well as I can tell him. And whereas
he says they fleeced <i>Clipperton</i> and let him
go; ’tis quite wrong; for <i>Clipperton</i> paid
but 1700 dollars for anchorage, as by the
journal, which is not 400 pound: and
<i>Shelvocke</i> owns he paid above 2000 pound,
p. 457: therefore ’tis manifest the latter
was fleeced, not the former.</p>

<p>Immediately after which he has these
words, “I thought it proper to make this
digression for the information of such of
the Gentlemen owners who have thought
<i>Clipperton</i> blameless, that they might pass
a judgment on his conduct: since it is
certain that he will never, either privately
or publicly, let them into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
truth of his story.”&mdash;What can be more
offensive than this, first to invent a falsehood,
and then say ’tis for the gentlemens information?
which he concludes with a jesuitical
turn, that <i>Clipperton</i> never would <i>publicly</i>
or <i>privately</i> let them into the truth of
his story; the only reason of which is a
mental reserve that honest Mr. <i>Shelvocke</i>
has, that truly he knew captain <i>Clipperton</i>
was dead.</p>

<p>What remains of this author, relating the
shifts he made to get himself and his money
transported to <i>England</i>, whether true or
false, tis immaterial to my design: and so I
leave him aboard an <i>East India-man</i> which
brought him home the first of <i>August, 1722</i>.
His 14th chapter, as it contains nothing of
our dispute, is no ways liable to my exception.
I believe his cautions and directions
to be very just, and may be useful to
any who shall go upon that cruise: but
his own behaviour is a proof, that it’s easier
to give good advice than to follow it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em class="gesperrt">THUS</em> have I taken fair pains gradually
to trace and answer captain <i>Shelvocke</i>: to
expose his ignorance in some things, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
detect his many wilful forgeries in others.
I have discoverd nothing of his wickedness
out of its proper place with design to prepossess
mankind; well knowing that where
truth is to be found, art is needless.</p>

<p>Upon the whole the reader may perceive
that he lays all the mischiefs of his
voyage to the obstinacy of his men, always
taking care to shift off the guilt from himself:
And to prepare his readers the better,
has the groundless assurance to say in the
fourth page, that they had actually formd a
design of returning with the ship to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>2. At St. <i>Catherine</i>’s he says they forced
him to sign the new articles, or else they
would have run away with the ship.</p>

<p>3. Going in to <i>Chiloe</i> he says was the mens
fault; where we so narrowly escaped a
shipwreck.</p>

<p>4. At going in to <i>Conception</i> a little to
leeward, he says the same.</p>

<p>5. At <i>Fernandes</i>, he says they forced him
to divide the Owners money, and enter
upon the new <i>Jamaica</i> discipline.</p>

<p>6. Upon meeting <i>Clipperton</i>, he says, ’twas
his men demanded a confirmation of the
first articles with the Owners, after they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
had twice made new ones for themselves.</p>

<p>7. When he left the four men aboard
the bark where they were murderd, he
says his people would not let him bring to
till she came up.</p>

<p>8. ’Twas his men also gave him an island,
and obstinately calld it after his name: the
vanity and inconsistency of all which I have
sufficiently exposed. But I would fain know
what forced him to conceal that great sum of
money taken aboard the <i>Conception</i>? Or
who obliged him to play the hypocrite and
keep it a secret when he publishd his book?
I could ask him many more questions that
would stagger him: particularly, who forced
him to dedicate his volume of scandal and
forgery to the lords of the admiralty? who
flatterd him into a belief, that their lordships
would patronize the author of so much
treachery and cruelty? and whom he has
had the unpardonable boldness to deceive
in the first line of his dedication; by telling
them, that having before had the honour
to present them the original minutes
of his transactions, he now has laid before
them a more perfect account of his procedings:
when at the same time he never kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
a journal, tho’ he says he lost one at <i>Fernandes</i>,
p. 417, which place I shall quote
for the <i>particularity</i> of it.&mdash;“When I was
shipwreckd on the island of <i>John Fernandes</i>,
I among many other things lost
some <i>particular</i> remarks and memorandums
of the ship’s way <i>et cætera</i>: therefore
in <i>general</i> have not been <i>particular</i>.”
I can’t tell what he would have the world
understand by this; but I and every common
sailor knows, that if a man loses the
particular memorandums of a ship’s way <i>et
cætera</i>, he has lost them in general <i>et cætera</i>.</p>

<p>If such language, such remarks and pitiful
forgeries can pass for <i>A voyage round
the world</i>, a man may e’en stay at home
and compose one. ’Tis nothing but a bundle
of falshood and scandal: and <i>John
Bunyan</i>’s Pilgrim’s progress is a much better
journal, and better writ.</p>

<p>For the entertainment of the curious I
shall here subjoyn a few of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s <i>blunderrata</i>;
tho’ the captain is said to have had
the assistance of his son, and his son the assistance
of the learned.</p>

<p>265. We had not an <i>hour’s</i> hopes of living
a <i>minute</i> longer, <i>&amp;c</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Soon as captain <i>Shelvocke</i> returnd to <i>London</i>,
he waited on the same gentleman I
have often mentiond, who framed and directed
this expedition; where being self-convicted
of his past wicked actions, he
hoped by a genteel donation to pacify the
resentment he expected to meet with: but
the said gentleman to whom he thus applyd,
was rather shockt at the visit; and instead
of hearkening to any terms, charged
a constable with him, and carryd him to the
<i>Cockpit</i>. The secretary of state being absent,
he was there advised to take out an action
against him at <i>Doctors commons</i>, and another
at <i>Common law</i> at the Owners suit;
with several processes against some of his
people, who came home in the <i>India</i> ships
with their ill gotten wealth. So that captain
<i>Shelvocke</i> was himself that day confined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
in <i>Wood-street Counter</i>; and a few days after
about a dozen of his crew, being all that
yet appeard, were arrested also and confined.</p>

<p>After this the said owner applyd to the
court of <i>Admiralty</i> for a warrant to keep
<i>Shelvocke</i> in custody of the marshal, in
order to be tryd for a pyracy on the <i>Portuguese</i>;
for robberies on the king of
<i>Spain</i>’s subjects since the cessation of arms;
and lastly for defrauding his owners and
people, affidavits having been made of
these several facts by two of his own
officers and others. But the court refused
him a warrant, because it was not sworn
that the witnesses saw the moydors taken
out of the <i>Portuguese</i> captain’s scritore;
tho’ they swore they were taken out of
his possession and brought from the ship.
This greatly disappointed the owners, and
involved them in the tedious law suit
which followd: for they found it difficult
to lay the action at <i>Doctors commons</i>, being
under the discouragement of the judge
of that court: and the proceding at <i>Common
law</i> was so intricate and doubtful,
that they were forced to seek relief in
the court of <i>Chancery</i>. Upon setting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
forth the case, the Lord chancellor granted
a writ of <i>Ne exeat regnum</i> against the
said <i>Shelvocke</i>, markt 8000<i>l</i>, and some of
his men in lesser sums: but <i>Shelvocke</i> getting
bail to the action at common law,
contrived so with the marshal of the king’s
bench prison, that he escaped on a <i>Sunday</i>,
and prevented the said writ in chancery
being served upon him; and has ever since
absconded. Mean time the bill in chancery
was carryd on, to which <i>Shelvocke</i> refusing
to put in answer; a writ of rebellion was
issued out: but a brother in law of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
applyd to two of the owners, being
complainants named in the bill, and so prevailed
with them, that they pretended
they were about a competition with the
defendent: so that a sudden stop was
made to the prosecution; except other
of the owners would exhibit a fresh bill,
and spend more money, having already
laid out above 400 pound: which however
was designd more to punish his unparalleld
wickedness, than for any real prospect of
advantage.</p>

<p>Now let mankind judge what a check
this must be to all future aid and assistance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
to the crown; when at any time a prince
upon a declaration of war, shall require his
loving subjects to fit out private ships to
cruise upon and annoy the enemy! Is it not
a temptation to the crew of any other
ship who carry only money aboard, to run
away with the vessel, come home in the
face of their imployers, and go to law with
their own masters money? Is it not to give
such men hopes of protection from the
laws of their own country, which surely
are made to punish, not defend the cruel
and the wicked? Here’s an example, where
a writ granted by the highest officer in the
kingdom has not been able to secure an
offender, who has found means by corrupt
practices to prevent the execution of it.
But yet more astonishing is this man’s assurance
to impose a scandalous narrative upon
the world for truth, to gloss over his cruelties
and robberies by the innocent name
of <i>A voyage round the world</i>; and after all,
dedicate this libel to the lords of the admiralty;
wherein he courts them for favours,
while there are repeated letters from
the king of <i>Spain</i> to demand satisfaction for
depredations upon his subjects, committed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
by this very man; and he still braving it
with impunity.</p>

<p>’Tis proper therefore to insert here, that
complaint was made to one of the principal
secretaries of state by the marquiss <i>de
Pozzo Bueno</i> ambassador from the king
of <i>Spain</i>, while his <i>Britannic</i> majesty was
at <i>Hanover</i>; “<i>That on the <span class="antiqua">11th</span> of <span class="antiqua">April
1721</span>, in the road of <span class="antiqua">Sansonate</span> on the
coast of <span class="antiqua">Mexico, George Shelvocke</span> commander
of an <span class="antiqua">English</span> privatier did then
and there make prize a ship calld the <span class="antiqua">Holy
Family</span>, value one hundred thousand dollars,
belonging to <span class="antiqua">Don Lewis Carillo</span> of
<span class="antiqua">Lima</span> in <span class="antiqua">Peru</span>; altho’ the said <span class="antiqua">Shelvocke</span>
had notice given him of a cessation of
arms agreed upon in the year <span class="antiqua">1720</span>, between
the crowns of <span class="antiqua">England</span> and <span class="antiqua">Spain</span>,
and publishd in those seas before the said
capture.</i>”&mdash;I have seen a copy of this
memorial, being writ in <i>French</i>, and sent
to one of our Owners; and here is now,
or was a <i>Spanish</i> agent in <i>London</i> to solicit
the business. It is hard to know how this
affair will be determined, now <i>Great Britain</i>
and <i>Spain</i> are at such variance; but if
the court of <i>Madrid</i> comes quickly into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
terms, which looks not improbable, the
government may still lay hold on <i>Shelvocke</i>
for all his robberies in the <i>South-Sea</i>, as well
as his pyracy on the <i>Portuguese</i>; tho’ courts
of justice either want the inclination or
power to punish him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here follows a distinct list of the number
of men, lost and destroyd according to
the will and pleasure of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>;
only 33 remaining out of 106 to divide the
whole profits of the cruise: and it is observable
that of all his people only two died a
natural death and two by casualty.</p>

<p>’Tis fit I say something to the memory of
captain <i>Clipperton</i>, who being this time so
extraordinary well fitted out, and having
been twice this cruise before, doubted not
of easily making a good voyage for the
Owners and All of us: but after he was
separated from the <i>Speedwel</i>, and under the
hardship of losing his stock of liquors; he
was forced to sail comfortless under a doubtful
expectation, till he came to the last scene
of action: where being still disappointed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
his consort, ’tis no wonder if he gave the
voyage over for lost. When afterwards he
did meet with captain <i>Shelvocke</i> on the
coast of <i>Mexico</i>, all his proposals proved
ineffectual. Thus <i>Clipperton</i> having in vain
made three foreign voyages, two of which
were round the globe, he took it to heart,
grew dejected, and in his passage to <i>Asia</i>
minded nothing at all. However, we see
by the journal that he kept good order,
and acted by council during his whole
cruise upon the enemy.</p>

<p>When he came to <i>China</i> he sold the <i>Success</i>,
laying by the Owners moiety as aforesaid:
then he arrived in <i>Holland</i>, aboard a
<i>Dutch East-India</i> ship, and died two or
three days after he came to his family
in <i>Ireland</i>; being heart-broke, as I am
well informd, at his long run of misfortune.</p>

<p>He was an <i>Englishman</i>, born at great <i>Yarmouth</i>
in the county of <i>Norfolk</i>, and used
to the water from his infancy. He was
certainly a complete seaman, as the northern
<i>English</i> generally are, and in all the south
navigation he was perfectly experienced.
His humanity and good nature are undeniable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
having never arbitrarily exposed or
commanded away the lives of any of his
people: and tho’ he had private failings,
they were common to mankind, and
not such as <i>Shelvocke</i> has unfairly represented.</p>

<p>My readers in general, as well as the
gentlemen adventurers, may here see that
the miscarriage of all this expedition is
wholly imputable to the captain of the
<i>Speedwel</i>, who cruelly treated his own
people; deserted the other ship till the
war was over; acted separately, and managed
every thing arbitrarily: tho’ our
orders were strictly to copy captain <i>Rogers</i>
his method, and in all attempts and
difficulties to act by a council of our own
officers.</p>

<p>So that if <i>Shelvocke</i> had early rejoynd the
<i>Success</i> and concurrd with <i>Clipperton</i>, according
to the said precedent, We who are
extreme sufferers had not only profited thereby,
but the advantages might have been
national. The charge of our expedition was
upwards of fourteen thousand pound, and
I believe the <i>Duke</i> and <i>Duchess</i> did not
stand the <i>Bristol</i> gentlemen in so much.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
And tho’ <i>Rogers</i> had aboard him some troublesom
spirits, who opposed his better
views, yet it’s well known he brought home
a capture of a <i>hundred and seventy thousand
pound</i> value. We were certainly as
well fitted out as they: and thus having
precedents and examples, what might we
not have done, if conducted, as they were,
with prudence, care and integrity!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">About</span> the middle of <i>March
1720</i>, when <i>Shelvocke</i> sent <i>Hatley</i>
and the rest of us to seek our
fortunes in the lighter, calld the
<i>Mercury</i>, he himself in the <i>Speedwel</i> went
to plunder the village of <i>Payta</i>, which was
just under our lee, and where we might
easily have joind him, had he imparted his design
to us: however we had not cruised long
in sight of <i>Cape Blanco</i>, when we took a
small bark with a good parcel of chocolate
and flower. There was an elderly gentlewoman
aboard, and a thin old fryer, whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
we kept two or three days; and after taking
out what we wanted, we discharged the
bark and them together.</p>

<p>Soon after this we took the pink which
<i>Shelvocke</i> calls the rich prize; She had no
jealousy of our being an enemy, but kept
her way to the southward, till seeing the
<i>Mercury</i> standing towards her she began to
suspect us. About noon she puts the helm
hard a weather, and crowded all the sail
she could afore the wind: and being in
her ballast this was the best of her sailing,
which also proved the greatest advantage
they could give us; for had she held her
wind, we in our flat bottom could have
had no share in her. About ten at night,
with rowing and hard sailing, we got within
shot of the chase and brought her to,
being pretty near the shore: they were about
seventy persons aboard, thirty of which
were <i>Nigros</i>. <i>Hatley</i>, I remember, upon
going aboard left me and <i>Pressick</i> with
four more hands in the <i>Mercury</i>; where we
continued two or three days, till a heavy
shower of rain (hardly ever known upon
that coast, and which <i>Shelvocke</i> takes notice
of p. 185) spoild all our bread and other dry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
provision; it was then time for us to get aboard
the prize, which we did; sending
three hands afterwards to take care of the
<i>Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>We stood off and on the said cape seven
or eight days expecting to meet with the
<i>Speedwel</i>; and there we set ashore the <i>Spanish</i>
captain, the <i>padre</i>, and some gentlemen passengers.
At last we spyd a sail about five
leagues distance, plying to windward: not
doubting it was the <i>Speedwel</i> or <i>Success</i>, we
stood towards her, while she kept edging
towards us. About ten in the morning
we were got near enough to discover it
was a warlike ship, as she proved; tho’ neither
of those we wishd for. The master
of our prize had before informd us, that he
met the <i>Brilliant</i> man of war cruising for
our privatiers; which till now we intirely
disregarded.</p>

<p>Hereupon captain <i>Hatley</i> advising with
me what to do we concluded that some
advantage might be made of the information
given us by the <i>Spaniard</i>: that as the
<i>Brilliant</i> had spoke so lately with the pink,
probably there would not be many questions
asked now. Upon which <i>Hatley</i> and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
drest our selves like <i>Spaniards</i>, and hoisted
<i>Spanish</i> colours: we confined our prisoners
in the great cabin, suffering none of them
but the <i>Indians</i> and <i>Nigros</i> to appear upon
deck, that the pink might look as she did
before; in which contrivance we had succeded,
but for the obstinacy of <i>John Sprake</i>,
whom we could not keep off the deck.</p>

<p>As the Admiral came up he fired a gun
to leeward: hereupon we lowerd our topsails,
making easy sail till we got along
side of him. Their first question was,
if we had heard any thing of the <i>English</i>
privatier? we answerd, No. The next was,
how it happend we were got no farther in
our way to <i>Lima</i>? We answerd, by reason
of the <i>currents</i>. They askd us two or three
more questions, which we still answerd in
<i>Spanish</i>. They seemd thoroughly satisfyd;
and were just getting their tacks aboard in
order to leave us, when the said <i>Sprake</i> and
two more of our men appeard on the main
deck: a <i>Frenchman</i> aboard the admiral looking
out at the mast-head spyd their long
trowsers, by which knowing them to be
<i>English</i> he cryd out, <i>par Dieu Monsieur,
ils sont Anglois</i>, they are <i>Englishmen</i>. Upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
this they immediately fired a broad side into
us with round and partridge shot; by
one of which <i>Hatley</i> was slightly wounded
in the head.</p>

<p>After we had surrenderd they took all
the <i>English</i> aboard them, and put a couple
of their own officers into the prize. The
admiral then bore down to the <i>Mercury</i> about
two leagues to leeward, and tho’ they
fired at least twenty five guns into her, the
three men escaped unhurt; and the vessel
tho’ full of water had not weight enough to
carry her to the bottom. After taking in
the three men, our commander <i>Don Pedro
Midranda</i> went in to <i>Payta</i> carrying the
pink with him, where he set us ashore. He
orderd me to <i>Piura</i> about forty mile up the
country; and did me the favour to let <i>Pressick</i>
the surgeon and <i>Cobs</i> a marine serjeant
go with me: but captain <i>Hatley</i> and the
rest he sent under a guard, with mules to
carry them to <i>Lima</i>, which is above four
hundred miles further on the coast; the reason
of which I have partly given at the close
of my second section: for the cape <i>Frio</i>
story being blown, and the moydors found
upon <i>Hatley</i>, they had a mind the thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
should be sifted and the guilty punishd. The
admiral having taken in water and refreshments,
quickly put to sea again in quest of
the <i>British</i> privatiers, designing to take us
up to <i>Lima</i> as he came back.</p>

<p>The weather in this latitude being too
hot, the custom is to travel from six in
the evening till eight in the morning. My
<i>Indian</i> guide set me on the best mule he
had, which not caring to follow company,
I led my fellow travellers the way till ten
a clock. While day-light lasted, I observed
the country one open plain, with <i>Indian</i>
plantations regularly enough cantond out
on each side of us. This level is from 30
to 100 mile broad, and extends 300 mile along
shore; for I am now going to the
southward, having the <i>Cordileer</i> mountains
on the left hand, and the great ocean on
the right. If this land was well waterd, as
the soil is pleasant and fertile, it might be
as fine a country as any: but travellers are
here obliged to carry water for their mules
as well as themselves. At the approach of
night we were puzzled in the way: I often
found my self stopt by great hills of
sand, and my mule as often indeavourd to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
pull the reins out of my hand, which proving
troublesome, the <i>Indian</i> advised me to
throw the reins on the mule’s neck; and
as soon as that was done the creature easily
hit the way. These sands are often shifted
by from place to place, which I take to be
occasiond by the strong eddies of wind reverberated
from the mountains. At night
we rested a little at an old empty house in
a coppice about half way, which the guide
told us was built by the inhabitants of <i>Piura</i>,
for the accommodation of the prince St.
<i>Bueno</i> viceroy of <i>Peru</i>, where they met
him in formality and regaled him.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning we arrived at
<i>Piura</i>, being a regular handsom town scituate
on the banks of the river <i>Collan</i>. The
<i>Indian</i> conducted us to the house of a good
<i>Spanish</i> gentleman and his wife who having
received his charge, the guide returnd to
<i>Payta</i>. In a quarter of an, hour’s time the
towns people flockd in to see the rary show;
and instead of being used like prisoners at
discretion, we were entertaind with respect
and civility, which we were not sure to meet
with. Our landlord, I should say keeper’s
name was <i>Don Jeronimo Baldivieso</i>. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
had five daughters, upon the sight of which
and their candid way of receiving us, we
hoped our time would slide easily away, and
our captivity prove agreeable. I began now
to be sensible of the admiral’s favour in ordering
us to this place; for he had such
interest in all the kingdom of <i>Peru</i>, that for
his sake we found good genteel treatment.
Soon as we had refreshd ourselves, according
to the custom of the place, with
chocolate, biskets and water; we were diverted
with the sound of a <i>Welch</i> harp in
some inner apartment: the artist had good
command of it; for I heard parts of several
famous <i>Italian</i>, as well as <i>English</i> compositions;
and upon inquiry, was informd
that all the <i>Spaniards</i> daughters had learnd
music, and sung or playd upon some instrument
or other. Tho’ at first this seemd a little
unaccountable to us, yet I afterwards found
that music was common in <i>Peru</i>: for the
<i>Italian</i> party having a few years before prevaild
at the court of <i>Madrid</i>, the said viceroy
prince St. <i>Bueno</i>, who was an <i>Italian</i>,
had brought a great many musicians of
that country along with him; which has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
now, spread music every where, and is as
good in <i>Peru</i> as in old <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>This I thought proper to mention, because
by means of music and an inoffensive
carriage, we lived in good harmony with
those who had a right to treat us as enemies.</p>

<p>It was a practice here every day for the
neighbours to come and view us; at which
I was well enough diverted: for <i>Cobs</i> being
my serjeant, we had exercised the brown
musket together; so that we turnd readily
about to shew our selves: but Mr. Pressick
hung down his head, and grew melancholy.</p>

<p><i>Payta</i> being the place, as I said afore,
where the pedlars or walking merchants are
set ashore, they make <i>Piura</i> their first stage
to <i>Lima</i>, disposing of their goods and lessening
their burthens as they go along:
some take the road through <i>Caxamarca</i>;
others through <i>Truxillo</i> along shore. From
<i>Lima</i> they take their passage back to <i>Panama</i>
by sea; and perhaps carry a little purchase
of brandy with them. At <i>Panama</i>
they again stock themselves with <i>European</i>
goods, returning by sea to <i>Payta</i>, where they
are set down: there they hire mules and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
load them; the <i>Indians</i> going with them,
in order to bring them back: and so these
traders keep in a continual round till they
have got enough to live on. Their traveling
expenses are next to nothing; for the <i>Indians</i>
are brought under such subjection, that
they find lodging for them, and provender for
their mules. This every white face may command,
being a homage the poor <i>Indians</i> are
long accustomd to pay; and some think they
have an honour done them into the bargain,
except out of generosity they now and then
meet with a small recompense. In the <i>British</i>
and <i>French</i> nation a pedlar is despised,
and his imployment lookd upon as a mean
shift to get a living: but it is otherwise
here, where the quick return of money is
a sufficient excuse for the manner of getting
it. And there are many gentlemen in <i>Old
Spain</i>, who, when their circumstances in
life are declining, send their sons to the <i>Indies</i>
to retrieve their fortune this very way.</p>

<p>Our lodging was in an outhouse purposely
kept for these traveling merchants. According
to the <i>Spanish</i> custom, we had our
dinner sent to table under cover, where
<i>Don Jeronimo</i> and we eat together; while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the good lady of the house and her daughters
sat together in another room: this is
the practice at all meals, and if any strong
liquors are drank, it is then. In all our conduct
I think the good <i>Spaniard</i> was never
disobliged, except once when he saw me
drinking a dram with the doctor at a little
victualing house. As nothing is more disagreeable
to the <i>Spaniards</i> than drunkenness,
I had much ado to make amends for
this step towards it, tho’ they easily admit
of gallantry in the most familiar degree:
so that ’tis only changing one enormity for
another. Here are several churches endowd;
one convent of <i>Franciscans</i>, and a seminary
for youth instructed by two <i>Jesuits</i>.</p>

<p>After we had past about six weeks at <i>Piura</i>,
our <i>Indian</i> guide came again to wait
on us to <i>Payta</i>, the man of war being returnd.
When we were upon the point of
taking leave, our surgeon was missing, which
retarded us a day longer: they had conceald
him in the town, and designd to
keep him there, being a very useful man:
and if he could have had a supply of medicines,
he might soon have made a handsom
fortune. However the next day we mounted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
our mules and parted with great reluctance,
especially with <i>Don Jeronimo</i> and
his family.</p>

<p>We went aboard the <i>Brilliant</i> at <i>Payta</i>,
which having done nothing at sea, made a
sort of cruising voyage to <i>Callao</i>, the port
of <i>Lima</i>. The civility I received from the
admiral or general of the <i>South-Seas</i>, as he
is there calld, is what I have touchd upon
at the end of my first section, both before
we were set ashore at <i>Payta</i>, and in our
passage from thence to <i>Callao</i>. I shall only
add one particular to the honour of <i>Monsieur
de Grange</i>, a captain under the general.
Soon as we were taken by the <i>Brilliant</i>,
as aforesaid, this gentleman seeing the soldiers
had stript us, being the conquerers
usual perquisit in all these cases; he generously
gave me a handsom sute of clothes,
two pair of silk stockins, a hat, wig, shirts,
and every thing according. We arrived at
<i>Lima</i> in about five weeks, and were immediately
committed to the same prison
where the rest of our companions were sent,
except <i>Hatley</i>, who, having a particular mark
set on him, was confined by himself. And
I can’t help remarking, tho’ Mr. <i>Hatley</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
was no friend to me, that it was a cruel
thing in <i>Shelvocke</i> to send him of all men
upon that enterprize in the <i>Mercury</i>. For
when captain <i>Rogers</i> came into these seas
upon a like cruise 1709, <i>Hatley</i> upon some
occasion was separated from him, and made
a prisoner afterwards upon the continent:
and now being catchd the second time,
with the aggravation of the <i>Portuguese</i> money
found upon him, he had like to have
been torn to pieces.</p>

<p>The court of judges went soon upon
the examination of our story, and drew up
a charge against us as pyrates: since by the
moidors found upon <i>Hatley</i>, it appeard they
were taken from the subjects of a prince
in perfect amity with the crown of <i>England</i>:
but it was happy for us that the viceroy
<i>Don Diego Marsilia</i>, who was an archbishop
and in the decline of life, was pleased
coolly to discriminate the affair, and finding
really but one of us guilty, would not
sign any order for shedding innocent blood.
As for <i>Hatley</i>, some were for sending him
to the mines for life; others for hanging him:
but the several accounts of capt. <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
vile procedings contributed to his deliverance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
the truth of which here were enough
of our people at <i>Lima</i> to witness. For
besides lieutenant <i>Serjeantson</i> and his men
who were brought hither, here came the
men whom <i>Shelvocke</i> sent with <i>Hopkins</i> to
shift for themselves in a poor empty bark,
who for want of sustenance were forced to
surrender to the <i>Indians</i>: so that the court
finding <i>Shelvocke</i> more a principal in the
pyratical story than <i>Hatley</i>, and believing
we had been plagued enough before we
came hither, they thought fit to let us all go
by degrees. <i>Hatley</i> indeed was kept in irons
about a twelvemonth, and then got to
<i>England</i>.</p>

<p>I was released out of prison in about ten
days, by the interest of captain <i>Fitzgerald</i>
a native of St. <i>Malo</i>, who was in favour
with the viceroy, and past his word for my
limitation at <i>Lima</i>. Upon inquiry for
Mr. <i>Serjeantson</i> and his men, I understood
that most of them had taken up the religion
of the country, had been christend, and
were dispersed among the convents in the
city. The first that I saw had got his new
catechise in one hand, and a pair of large
beads dangling in the other. I smiled, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
askd the fellow how he liked it: he said
very well; for having his religion to chuse,
he thought this better than none, since it
brought him good meat and drink, and a
quiet life. Many of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s men followd
this example;  and I may venture to say
this was as good a reason as most of our
people could give for their conformity. Tho’
’tis reckond very meritorious to make a convert,
and many arguments were used for
that end; yet was there no rigour shewn
to bring any of us over. Those who thought
fit to be baptized, had generally some of
the merchants of <i>Lima</i> for their <i>padrinos</i>
or god-fathers, who never faild giving their
children a sute of clothes, and some money
to drink their healths.</p>

<p>About this time four or five of <i>Clipperton</i>’s
men, and as many of <i>Shelvocke</i>’s got
leave from their convents to meet together
at a public house kept by one <i>John
Bell</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>, who had a <i>Nigro</i>
wife that for some services or other had got
her freedom. The design of this meeting
was to confirm their new baptism with a
bowl of punch: the consequence of which
was, they all got drunk and quareld; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
forgeting they were true catholics, mistook
an image of some good saint that stood in
a corner for one of their own company,
knockd him down, and demolishd him. I
missing the fellows for a few days, inquired
at <i>John</i>’s house what was become of them.
He told me the story, and said they were
all put in the <i>Inquisition</i>; for the thing having
took air, he was obliged to complain
of it, or go there himself: but promised
that underhand he would indeavour to get
them released; which I found afterwards
was done in five days: so that they had time
enough to say their catechise, repent and be
sober. <i>Bell</i> said, if the men had still remaind
heretics, this drunken-bout had not
come within the verge of the ecclesiastical
power; but being novices, and just let into
the church, they were the easier pardond;
since their outrage upon the saint was no
proof of their relapse into error, or an affront
to the catholic faith, because they
were all disorderd with liquor.</p>

<p>At length about a dozen men of both
our ships, being now pretty well instructed,
were discharged from the cloysters, and sent
to <i>Callao</i> to help careen and fit out the <i>Flying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Fish</i>, then designd for <i>Europe</i>. Here
they enterd into a project to run away with
the <i>Margarita</i>, a pretty sailing ship that
lay in the harbour, and go upon the account
for themselves: but not knowing what to
do for ammunition and a compass, they
applyd to Mr. <i>Serjeantson</i>, telling him they
had a design to steal away by land to <i>Panama</i>,
where being an <i>English</i> factory, they
might have a chance to get home; that they
had got half a dozen firelocks with which
they could kill wild hogs or get some game
as they went along, if he would be so kind
to help them to a little powder and shot,
and a compass to steer their way through
the woods: the fellows, by begging and
making catholic signs to the good people at
<i>Lima</i>, that they were poor <i>English</i> newly
baptized, had got together some dollars which
they desired <i>Serjeantson</i> to lay out; who
not mistrusting the plot, took their money
and bought them what they wanted. Thus
furnisht one of them came to me at <i>Lima</i>,
and said there was an opportunity offered
to make my fortune, by running away with
the <i>Margarita</i> at <i>Callao</i>, if I would imbrace
it: whereupon he told me the story, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
that <i>Sprake</i> was to have the command, as
being the only artist among them. I answerd
that it was a bold design; but as captain
<i>Fitzgerald</i> had ingaged for my honour,
I was obliged not to meddle with it. In a
few days the plot was discoverd, their lodgings
were searchd, their arms taken away
and they put in prison. The government
was greatly provoked, and had near determined
their execution, when an order came
to release all but <i>Sprake</i>; who being the
projector was kept in irons two or three
months and then set free. I believe, in
this affair their late conformity did them
great service: but both these stories are an
argument, that neither the <i>church</i> nor <i>state</i>
are so rigorous in <i>Peru</i>, as the <i>Romish</i> dominions
in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</h2>

<p><i>Describing the City of <span class="antiqua">Lima</span>.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase"><i>Lima</i></span> is the metropolis of <i>Peru</i> and
the seat of an archbishop. ’Tis a regular
built city, the streets all strait and spacious:
so that you go thro’ it almost any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
way without turning a corner. It is composed
of little squares like <i>St. Jago</i> the capital
of <i>Chili</i>, which is copyd from this. It
stands in an open vale, having only a gentle
stream to water it; and which divides it
as the <i>Thames</i> dos <i>London</i> from <i>Southwark</i>,
allowing for the great disproportion. The
port of <i>Lima</i> is at <i>Callao</i> seven mile below
it. The houses are only one story high,
of twelve or fourteen foot, because of the
frequent earthquakes in that country. There
are about eight parishes, three colleges for
students, twenty eight monasteries of fryers,
and thirteen monasteries of nuns: so that
the religious take up a fourth part of the
city. However by the easy flow of money,
and the vast sums bequeathd, being the effects
of celibacy, they are all well endowd
and supported. Besides which, there are two
hospitals for the sick, poor and disabled;
and where several of our men were kindly
lookt after. The length of the city from
north to south is two mile: the breadth one
and a half; the wall with the river making
a circumference of six mile. On the east
side of the stream lies the other part of the
city; being joynd by a very handsom stone
bridge of five or seven arches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>I compute there are now sixty or seventy
thousand persons in <i>Lima</i>, all sorts and colours
included: and I don’t wonder at any
multiplication in a city which is the centre
of so much affluence and pleasure. For besides
the natural increase of the inhabitants,
all ships which trade that way, whether private
or public, generally leave some deserters
who chuse to stay behind for the incouragement
all white faces meet with.</p>

<h3>The Inhabitants are thus distinguisht.</h3>

<p>Issue of <i>sambo mulatta</i>, and <i>sambo indian</i> are
calld <i>giveros</i>. These are lookt on as having
the worst inclinations and principles; and
if the cast is known, they are banisht the
kingdom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hence procede endless denominations according
to the variety of mixture: and some
people make a science of it, to know the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
multiplicity of casts and give them a name:
but the forementiond are the chief and most
particular. It is counted creditable to mend
the breed by ascending or growing whiter;
but a descent or cast the other way is calld
<i>saltatras</i>; from <i>saltare retrò</i>, to go backward;
and is lookd upon as base born and
scandalous.</p>

<p>The difference of birth and parentage
causes an observation pleasant enough: for
they are as great strangers to each other as
<i>chevaliers</i> are in <i>France</i>, or graduates and
scholars in our universities. So that a <i>quartron
indian</i> will hardly keep company with
a <i>mulatta</i>: and a <i>mestizo</i> thinks himself a
king to a <i>sambo</i>.</p>

<p>Of all parts of the world, the people here
are most expensive in their habit. The men
dress as they do in <i>England</i>, their coats being
either of silk, or fine <i>English</i> cloth,
and hair camblets imbroiderd or laced with
gold and silver, and their waistcoats commonly
the best brocades. The women never
wear hoops or stays, only a sticht holland
jacket next their shifts: they generally throw
over their shoulders a square piece of swanskin
flannel intirely coverd with <i>Flanders</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
lace, besides the silver or gold lace round
the peticoat: when they walk out, the
<i>Creolian</i> women are veild, but not the <i>Mulatta</i>;
and till the age of thirty or forty
they wear no headcloths: their hair being
tyed behind with fine ribands. But the
pride of both sexes appears chiefly in <i>Maclin</i>
and <i>Brussels</i> lace, with which they trim their
linen in a most extravagant manner, not
omitting their sheets and pillows. Beside the
outward covering of the mantle aforesaid,
their linen is doubly borderd with it top
and bottom, with ruffles of four or five
furbelows hanging down to the knee. Then
as to pearls and costly stones, which they
wear in rings and bracelets for the neck and
arms, they are very immoderate; though the
value is hardly equal to the appearance.</p>

<p>Of all the convents in <i>Lima</i>, that of
<i>St. Domingo</i> is the richest, and <i>Francisco</i>
the largest. The provincial or governer of
the <i>Dominicans</i> is chosen triennially out
of their own body, and his income above
seven thousand pound a year. I was present
at one election, which I mention because
of the great splendor and cost which
attended it. A large triumphal arch was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
built cross the street: the inside lined with
scarlet cloth and velvet, and hung all over
with jewels and wrought plate. Thro’ this
the principal people of <i>Lima</i> past with the
new provincial at their head; where he
stopd to hear a short oration pronounced
by a girl upon that occasion, and then went
to his convent to finish the solemnity.</p>

<p>The processions in <i>Lima</i> are made with
more show and pageantry than those in
<i>Europe</i>, and are sometimes very extravagant.
I was present at that noted one when
the image of <i>St. Dominic</i> goes to church
to wait upon that of <i>St. Francis</i>, which is
attended with a deal of firework and equipage:
and I doubt not the managers of
our opera and comedy would improve much
by seeing the odd figures and machinery
of this grand visit, which is made yearly to
keep up the singular esteem the <i>Spaniards</i>
have for those two orders. Tho’ these expenses
are profuse, yet at <i>Lima</i> they are
common, where the begging fryers often
die possest of dollars, from the value of ten
to twenty thousand pound. One instance
of the riches of this place, I was told by
several who rememberd it: that when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
duke <i>de la Plata</i> their viceroy made his
entry, the inhabitants paved the merchant
street thro’ which he past with bars of silver,
each of which was 2500 dollars at least:
which piece of finery I can liken to nothing
but the account we have of <i>Jerusalem</i> in
the days of king <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

<p>The viceroy has a handsome palace in
the great quadrangle of the city; which I
take to be near as large as <i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>
at <i>London</i>. His salary is ten thousand
pound a year, and his perquisits double
that sum: and tho’ his government expires
at three, four, or five years end as the king
pleases, yet ’tis supposed he makes a good
fortune for life; for he has all places in
his gift, both in the government and army
throughout <i>Peru</i>, except particular persons
are sent or nominated by the king.</p>

<p>The judicial court consists of twelve judges,
not to mention the inferior officers, council
and solicitors. Here all causes should come to
be decided; but they are too often determined
aforehand in favour of the party who gives
most mony. And tho’ these vast dominions abound
in riches, yet there is not abundance
of work for the lawyers; because the statutes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
are few and plain: which is certainly
happier than a multitude of laws <i>explaining</i>
one another ’till they are so <i>intricate</i> that
the issue of a cause depends more upon the
craft of the solicitor and advocate, than the
truth of the case. Moreover, a multiplication
of laws begets an infinity of attorneys
and council, who live high and great
upon the distresses of other people, and as
often argue a man <i>out</i> of his right as <i>into</i>
it.</p>

<p>Yet in <i>Peru</i> there are <i>corregidors</i> or magistrates
in districts from <i>Lima</i> who find
ways and means to oppress the poor <i>Indians</i>,
notwithstanding they are perjured
if they trade with them. These natives
live chiefly by husbandry and working the
mines; and the <i>Spanish</i> court have found
it necessary to forbid the <i>corregidors</i> trading
with them, in order to secure them a quiet
possession of the fruit of their labour. To
evade this oath, another person under-hand
procures a parcel of <i>European</i> goods and
disperses them among the <i>Indians</i>, who,
tho’ they want none of them, must buy
them at 3 or 400 <i>per cent.</i> more than prime
cost; a time being positively fixt for the
money.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>These hardships are past retrieving, because
every magistrate knows his reign to
be but short, and if he don’t make a fortune
he is laught at: So that they wink at
one another; and the great distance between
<i>Peru</i> and <i>Spain</i> is a reason the king’s orders
are seldom regarded, being two years
going backward and forward: whence arise
many clandestine doings. For according
to law, the king should have a twentieth
part of all gold, and a fifth part of all silver;
but there are vast quantities that never
pay duty carryd privately over the continent
the north way, as well as the south
way by trading ships. And tho’ there are
prodigious sums allowd for militia, garisons,
and repairs of fortifications: yet it is not one
half applyd. From all which it is easy to
imagine what immense revenues would come
to the treasury at <i>Madrid</i>, if his <i>Catholic</i>
majesty was but faithfully served.</p>

<p>The country in <i>Peru</i> is naturally subject
to earthquakes: and I have heard that the
<i>English</i> plantations in the north of <i>America</i>
have felt them. At <i>Lima</i> they had
two great ones about fifty years ago, which
overturnd houses, churches and convents:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
and in the reign of <i>Charles</i> the late king of
<i>Spain</i>, there was an earthquake near the
equinoctial line that lifted up whole fields,
and carryd them several miles off. Small
shocks are often felt without doing any
harm; and I have been two or three times
calld out of bed when such a thing has happend,
tho’ we have heard no more of it:
but upon these occasions the bells always
toll to prayers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this country, especially
nigh the coast, has sufferd much by earthquakes;
yet their churches are lofty enough,
and neatly built. That part of their architecture
which requires most strength is generally
finisht with burnt bricks; but their
houses are all built with <i>bambo</i> canes and
bricks dryd only by the weather, which are
durable enough because it never rains. The
covering is a matting with ashes upon it
to keep out the dews, which is all the wet
they have.</p>

<p>The small river of <i>Lima</i> is mostly snow
water descending from the neighbouring
mountains, which are coverd all the year
with snow; but partly dissolved in the summer
season, which is from <i>September</i> to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
<i>March</i>. One would expect it much hotter
thereabouts than it is, there being no proportion
between the heat of this climate
in <i>America</i> and the same degree of latitude
in <i>Africa</i>; for which there are two reasons:
one is the cool temper of the air proceding
from the congealed snow on the
mountains, which diffuses it self every way:
the other is, the humidity of the vapours
which hang over the plains, and which are
so frequent, that when I came first to <i>Lima</i>,
I often expected it would rain. These vapours
are not so coarse, low and humble
as our fogs, nor separated above like our
summer clouds; but an exhalation between
both, being spread all round, as when we
say the day is overcast. So that sometimes
a fine dew is felt upon the outward garments
and discernd by the eye upon the nap of
the cloth. This is a happy convenience at
<i>Lima</i>, the people being thus screend one
half of the day from the sun; and tho’ the
afternoon be sunshine, ’tis very tolerable being
mixt with the sea breezes, and not near
so hot as at <i>Lisbon</i>, and some parts of <i>Spain</i>
in <i>Europe</i> which are thirty degrees further
from the equator.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>The want of rain in this part of the continent
obliged the poor, I should say happy
<i>Indians</i>, before the conquest, to make dreins
and canals for bringing down water from
among the distant mountains; which they
have done with such great labour and skill
that the vallies are kindly refresht, producing
grass, corn, and variety of fruits: to which
the aforesaid dews may also a little contribute.</p>

<p><i>Zarate</i> the <i>Spanish</i> historian has given
us the natural cause of this perpetual drought.
He observes that the south-west winds blow
upon the <i>Peruvian</i> coast all the year round;
and the ocean is therefore calld <i>pacific</i>, because
the winds never disturb the waters.
These easy gales always bear away the vapours
from the plains before they can rise
and form a body sufficient to descend in a
shower: but when they are carryd farther
and higher, they grow more compact and
at length fall by their own weight into
rain.</p>

<p>This is so fair and rational an account,
that I wonder <i>Monsieur Frezier</i> has affected
to contradict it. ’Tis convincing to a stranger;
and to most gentlemen there who are curious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
enough to think about it. Any one
who reads <i>Frezier</i>’s voyage may see he
has not only mistaken the <i>Spaniard</i>, but
given us long conjectures of his own, very
confused and improbable.</p>

<p>They have plenty of cattle, fowl and
fish; and all provision common to us except
butter; instead of which they always
use lard. They have oyl, wine and brandy
enough, tho’ not so good as in <i>Europe</i>.
They drink much of the jesuits herb <i>camini</i>
brought from <i>Paraguay</i> by land; for
all <i>East-India</i> tea is forbid. They make a
decoction of it, and suck it through a pipe
or quill. It is generally here calld <i>mattea</i>,
being the name of the bowl out of which
they drink it. Chocolate is their usual breakfast
and a grace-cup after dinner: Sometimes
they drink a glass of brandy for digestion,
but scarce any wine at all. In the
kingdom of <i>Chili</i> they make a little butter,
such as it is; and their way of doing it is
remarkable. The cream is put into a sheepskin
stript off whole, and kept on purpose:
after tying the ends fast, two women lay it
on a table, and shake it and sowse it between
them ’till it comes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>Tho’ the <i>Spaniards</i> are no friends to the
bottle, yet gallantry and intrigue are here
brought to perfection, for they devote so
much of their time to the service of the
fair sex, that <i>Venus</i> seems here to keep her
court. It is unmannerly not to have a mistress,
and scandalous not to keep her well.
As for the women they have many accomplishments
both natural and acquired; their
conversation is free and sprightly, their motion
graceful, their looks winning, and their
words ingaging: they have all a delicate
shape, not injured with stiff bodyd stays,
but left to the beauty of nature; so that
there’s no such thing as a crooked body among
them. Their eyes and teeth are particularly
excellent, and their hair being generally
of a dark polisht hue is finely combd,
and platted or tyd behind with ribands, but
never disguised with powder: for the brightness
of their skin round the temples appears
very well shaded thro’ the hair like light
thro’ a landskip.</p>

<p>Tho’ these amours are universal at <i>Lima</i>,
yet the men are careful enough to hide them;
for no indecent word or action is allowd
in public. They have two usual times for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
these entertainments: one is at the <i>siesta</i> or
afternoons nap, which is commonly with
the mistress; the other is in the evening
cross the water in calashes, or at the great
square in the town where the calashes meet
in great numbers towards the dusk: these are
slung like our coaches, but smaller; and many
of them fit only for two sitting opposite.
They are always drawn by one mule with
the <i>nigro</i> driver upon his back: and it is
usual among these calashes to observe several
of them with the windows close up,
standing still for half an hour together.</p>

<p>In these pastimes they have several customs
peculiar to themselves. After evening prayers
the gentleman changes his dress, from a cloak
into a <i>montero</i> or jocky coat, with a linen
laced cap and a hankerchief about his neck
instead of a wig. If he wears his hair it must
be tuckt under a cap, and that flapt all down:
so that it is a universal fashion to be disguised
some way or other; for those who have no
mistress are ashamed to be thought strictly
virtuous, and must be in some mask or other
to countenance the way of the world.
But as all this is night work, they have an
establisht rule to prevent quarels, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
never to speak or take notice of one another;
whether they are going in quest of
amorous game, or visiting their ladies: so
that in short the forepart of the night is a
masquerade all the year round.</p>

<p>Among that rank of people who don’t
keep calashes there are several points to be
observed. Particularly when they take the
evening air, one couple never walks close upon
the heels of another; but to prevent the
publishing any secret whispers, each couple
walks at the distance of twelve yards at
least: and if any lady drops a fan or any
thing by accident, a gentleman may civilly
take it up; but he must not give it to the
lady, but the gentleman who is with her;
for she may be the sister or wife of him that
takes it up: and as the women are all veild,
these wise laws are instituted to prevent any
impertinent discoveries. A freedom of that
kind is lookt upon as the highest affront
in all gallantry, and merits a drawn sword
thro’ the liver. They are so careful in these
rules, that if a man sees his intimate friend
any where with a girl, he must in no wise
take notice of him, or speak of it afterwards:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>These things are all done with the greatest
gravity imaginable; and thus the practice
of love becomes decent, safe and easy: so
that a man may possess his mistress without
any visible inconvenience, and spend all
the money he has in the world without
fear of brawls, duels, or a roundhouse: not
like the rude hectoring blades and prentices
of a certain <i>northern</i> metropolis who are
continually affronting the female sex, with
shocking words or scandalous actions.</p>

<p>Altho’ the commerce of love is here so
regularly settled, yet there are some jealousies
now and then subsisting, which sometimes
have ended fatally. There was a story
of this sort pretty fresh when I was at <i>Lima</i>.
A young lady had for some time, as she
thought, been sovereign mistress of her lover’s
heart; but by cruel chance she found
him in company with another woman, and
perhaps a handsome one. As <i>Shakespear</i>
says, <i>Trifles light as air are to the jealous
confirmations strong</i>: so she waited for no
further proof of his infidelity, nor any excuse
for the wrong done her; but suddenly
drew his dagger and dispatchd him. She
was soon confined and brought to tryal:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
and when every one expected she would be
cast for her life, her judges gave it this
turn, that it was not malice fore-thought,
but excess of love that prompted her to the
rash deed. Whereupon she was acquitted:
but the nice casuists thought she should in
honour have hangd her self. This instance
shews how sacred a thing love is there judged
to be, tho’ in a state of concubinage only.
And the moral good or evil of some actions
are hard to be determined, while different
governments have different customs.</p>

<p>How agreeable soever these practices are
to the <i>Creole Spaniards</i>, yet they cause a
great inconvenience to society: for the men
are so seriously taken up with their delicacies,
that the women ingross most of their
time, and spoil all public conversation. For
this reason there are no taverns or coffee-houses,
so that the men are only to be met
with at their offices or at church. They
have a sort of playhouse where the young
gentlemen and students divert themselves after
their fashion: for what performances
they have in the dramatical way are so
mean, that they are hardly worth mentioning,
being scripture stories interwoven with romance
and obscenity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>It was at this theatre that two <i>English</i>
sailors of <i>monsieur Martinet</i>’s squadron
fought a prize a little before I came to <i>Lima</i>.
They first obtaind leave of the viceroy to
exercise at the usual weapons; and after
the shew-day was fixt, most of the preceding
time was taken up with preparatory ceremonies
to bring a good house. They
each traversed the town by beat of drum
in their holland shirts and ribands, saluting
the spectators at their windows with a
learned flourish of the sword; so that by
the extraordinary novelty and manner of
the thing, the whole city came to see the
tryal of skill: some gave gold, but few less
than a dollar. When the company male
and female was close packt up together, the
masters mounted the stage: and after the
usual compliment peculiar to the <i>English</i>
nation of shaking hands before they quarel,
they retired in great order and stood
upon their guard. Several bouts were playd
without much wrath or damage: but the
design of this meeting being more to get
money than cuts or credit, one of the masters
had the seasonable fortune to receive a
small harm on the breast, which having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
blooded his shirt began to make the combat
look terrible: whereupon the company
fearing from such a dreadful beginning that
the zele of the champions might wax too
intemperate; and till they were reconciled,
no man in the house was safe, unanimously
cryd out <i>basta, basta</i>, which signifys enough,
enough; and so the house broke up. The
sailors finding this a better prize than any
they ever made at sea, humbly besought his
excellency for another trial of skill: but
the viceroy and people were all against it,
from a religious objection which could never
be got over; and that was, lest the
fellows should kill one another, die without
absolution and be damnd.</p>

<p>While I was at <i>Lima</i>, I grew acquainted
with one <i>monsieur Thaylet</i>, a gentleman
whose effects were seised by <i>Martinet</i>’s squadron,
as an interloper from St. <i>Malo</i>: after
which he remaind in <i>Peru</i>, where he was
imployd by the government, he having been
formerly commander of several good ships.
The first service he had, was to fetch the
bottle with instructions for <i>Shelvocke</i>, buryd
by <i>Clipperton</i> at <i>Fernandes</i>, p. 97 of
this book. On his return with the said instructions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
and the two men who deserted
there, the viceroy willing to incourage him,
thought of another short expedition for him
in the same vessel; being an <i>English</i> ketch
of about sixty ton, and had served captain
<i>Martinet</i> as a tender. The viceroy having
lately had certain notice by a <i>Spanish</i> ship,
that they accidentally made an island in
the <i>South-Seas</i> till then unknown to them,
tho’ markt in several drafts by the name of
<i>Solomon</i>’s island; it made his excellency curious
to persue the discovery. He thereupon
orderd the ketch to be fitted out for
two months under <i>Thaylet</i>’s command; who
accordingly saild into ten degrees south, in
which latitude the island was said to lye.
He cruised thereabout till his provision was
nigh expended; and returnd without success.
However as the same account came
by two different ships who touchd there,
the <i>Spaniards</i> verily believe there is such a
place; for the men reported, that the natives,
as to their persons and behaviour, were
much like the <i>Indians</i> on the continent;
that they had many gold and silver things
among them, but that their language was
new and unintelligible. The reason why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Mr. <i>Thaylet</i> could not meet with <i>Solomon</i>’s
island, might be from the uncertainty of
the latitude, and his inability of making
further search, being provided for only two
months: for I have been informd in <i>London</i>
that the said island or islands lye more
southerly in the <i>Pacific</i> ocean than where
they are laid down in the <i>Dutch</i> maps.
And the two <i>Spaniards</i> who had been there,
were only small trading vessels carryd thither
by irregular currents; and could give no
certain account of the latitude, because they
kept no reckoning.</p>

<p>To sum up this chapter, I shall only observe
that the <i>Spanish Peruvians</i> are better
seated for the happiness of this world, than
any people I know. If they are indolent,
their great affluence makes them so. If
they are delicate, the kind serenity of the
climate contributes greatly to it. Much
husbandry and labor is needless, where the
whole year is a fruitful spring. Indeed the
<i>Nigros</i> and <i>Indians</i> do all the work; for
a white face is exemption enough from all
labor and care. In our unequal gloomy
regions, many customs would be condemnd,
which are there the pure effect of nature:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
for the night and day make a happy medium
between cold and heat. Therefore,
if the general bent of human nature be for
constant happiness and freedom from pain,
the man of pleasure must go to <i>Peru</i>, and
make <i>Lima</i> his temporal paradise.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the mines of <span class="antiqua">Chili</span> and <span class="antiqua">Peru</span>; and the
method of working out the <span class="antiqua">gold</span> and
<span class="antiqua">silver</span> from the mass.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase"><i>Chili</i></span> being the southermost division
of the continent of <i>America</i>, is therefore
cooler than <i>Peru</i>; and perhaps would
sute an <i>English</i> constitution better. It is
divided from <i>Peru</i> at the tropic of <i>Capricorn</i>;
and is remarkable for that vast chain
of mountains known by the name of <i>Cordileer</i>,
which coast along from <i>Magellan</i>
streights up to the <i>istmus</i> of <i>Darien</i>, being
about 4000 mile. It is governd by a lieutenant
general, stiled <i>president</i> of <i>Chili</i>, because
he is at the head of all civil affairs as
well as military: nevertheless he receives
orders from the viceroy of <i>Peru</i>. The capital
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
city is St. <i>Jago</i>; it was founded in
1541, and is a copy of <i>Lima</i>.</p>

<p>I shall here entertain the reader chiefly
with an extract from <i>Frezier</i>’s voyage relating
to the mines, and the manner of separating
the mineral from the earth. He undertook
the <i>South-Sea</i> voyage by permission
of king <i>Lewis</i> the XIV<sup>th</sup>, and was there about
six years before us, on purpose to make
such discoveries, plans and observations as
he thought fit. His account, as it is good
and intirely new, will without doubt be
agreeable to the curious reader:</p>

<p>In <i>Chili</i>, the mines which at present yield
most gold, are about the towns of <i>Conception</i>
and <i>Copiapo</i>; and the villages of <i>Tiltil</i>
and <i>Lampanqui</i> near <i>Valparaiso</i>; tho’ the
whole mountains are more or less impregnated
with it. The silver mines of <i>Peru</i>
are at <i>Lipes</i>, <i>Guaico</i>, <i>Iquic</i> and St. <i>Anthony</i>:
gold ones being very scarce in that part of
the continent. <i>Potosi</i> has originally afforded
such surprising quantities of silver, that it
has been proverbial for its treasure: the
town stands at the bottom of the famous
mountain where the mines lye, and is very
populous. The country is obliged by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
king’s order to send a great number of <i>Indians</i>
yearly to work in those mines; for
all white faces are excused from servitude,
and the <i>Nigros</i> are not able to work in
them because the cold will kill them: but
they are imployd in all other business on the
surface; so that the native <i>Indians</i> are only
destined to this labour.</p>

<p>The <i>Corregidors</i> or magistrates who overlook
those <i>Indians</i> appointed to work in
the mines, summon them to set out all together
on a certain day. They generally
take their wives and children with them,
who, with tears in their eyes, leave their
native homes, and travel unwillingly on to
the house of bondage. Many indeed forget
their habitation, and after the years
end settle at <i>Potosi</i>, which is the chief reason
that town is so populous, and almost
equals the city of <i>Lima</i> as to its number
of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Tho’ the mines here are far diminisht in
their produce, yet the quantity of ore that
has been already wrought, and lain many
years upon the surface, is thought capable
to yield a second crop; and when I was
at <i>Lima</i>, they were actually turning it up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
and new milling it with great success: which
is a proof that these minerals generate in
the earth like all other inanimate things.
And it is likewise certain from all accounts
of the <i>Spaniards</i>, that gold and silver, as
well as other metals, are continually growing
and forming themselves in the earth.
This opinion is verifyd by experience in
the mountain of <i>Potosi</i>, where several mines
have fallen in and buryd the workmen with
their tools. After some years they have
dug the same place, and discoverd many
bones and pieces of wood with veins of
silver actually running through them.</p>

<p>These mines belong to him who first discovers
them. He immediately presents a
petition to the magistrates to have such a
piece of earth for his own; which is no
sooner done than granted. They measure
eighty <i>Spanish</i> yards in length and forty
over, which is about two hundred foot in
length and one hundred in breadth, and
yield it to the discoverer; who chuses what
space he thinks fit, and does what he pleases
with it. Then they measure just the same
quantity for the king, which is sold to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
best bidders; there being many who are willing
to purchase a treasure which may prove
inestimable. If any other person has a mind
to work part of the mine himself, he bargains
with the proprietor for a particular
vein. All that such a one digs out is his
own, paying the king’s duty, which is for
gold a 20th part, and for silver a 5th: And
some landlords are so well satisfyd with
letting out their ground and their mills,
that they live upon the profit.</p>

<p>The mill for grinding and separating the
gold from the ore is made after the manner
of our cyder mills. There is first a round
stone cistern about ten foot diameter, with
a deep orbicular chanel at the bottom.
This stone cistern is bored in the middle to
let thro’ the long axil-tree of a horizontal
wheel placed under it, and wider than the
cistern: the wheel is set round with half
pitchers, that it may turn as the water falls
upon them. This wheel turning the axil,
causes a milstone to roll along edgeways by
another spindle in the chanel of the cistern
above, which grinds the hard ore put in it.</p>

<p>When the stuff is a little broken, they
put quick-silver to it, which immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
clings to the gold, and leaves the dross:
then they let fall a stream of water, the
force of which dissolves the earth, and drives
it out at a notch made for that purpose. The
gold with the mercury lyes at the bottom
by its own weight; which, after they have
done work, they gather up and put into a linen
bag to squeese out the quick silver as well
as they can: then they lay it to the fire, that
the remainder may evaporate. This is what
they call <i>pinna</i> gold, being clung together
like a pine apple; and when this is once
melted, it needs no more refining: so that
a gold miner has a great advantage of a silver
one; for the mercury, adhering so naturally
to the gold, leaves all the dross immediately,
and the workman knows every
day what he gets: whereas the silver miner
can’t know till a month or two after.</p>

<p>The silver ore is ground as the gold aforementiond,
or sometimes broke with iron
pounders of 200 weight to fall by a machine.
But milling being the usual way,
they grind the ore with water, which makes
first a thin mud that runs out of the cistern
into a receiver: whenas ’tis dry pounded,
it must be steept in water and moulded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
with the feet, which occasions much more
trouble.</p>

<p>The mud is disposed in square parcels of
a hundred weight a piece, upon a smooth
floor made on purpose. On each of these
they throw a great quantity of salt, and
mix it all together for two or three days;
then they sprinkle it equally with quicksilver,
on each mass perhaps about fifteen
pound; for the richer it is, the more mercury
it requires. An <i>Indian</i> moulds each
of these squares seven or eight times a day,
that the mercury may incorporate. Sometimes
the ore is greasy, and then they put
lime to it: wherein they are cautious; for
it is very remarkable, that sometimes it is
so burnt with heat, that the mercury and
silver are both lost. Now and then they
intermix a little lead to help the operation
of the quicksilver, which is but slow in cold
weather. So that at <i>Lipes</i> and <i>Potosi</i> they
are a matter of six weeks kneading the ore:
and at <i>Puno</i> particularly, they lay a brick
pavement upon arches, under which they
make fires to help the works: but in other
countries they do it in eight or ten days.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>When the workman thinks the mercury
has attracted all the silver, he takes out a
little bit, and washes it in a basin. If the
mercury looks dark, the ore is too much
heated; to remedy which, they add more
salt, which makes the quicksilver evaporate.
If the mercury is white, they squeeze a drop
of it under the thumb: the silver sticks to
the skin, and the mercury slips away. This
they find will do; so that when all the silver
is gatherd up by the mercury, they give
the ore three different washings: and when
all the dross is gone, they put the silver in
a woollen bag, which they press between
boards, to get the quicksilver out. After
’tis hung up, draind and prest as much as
they can, they put it into a wooden mould,
generally the form of a sugar loaf, with
thin copper plates at the bottom full of
holes.</p>

<p>After taking off the moulds, these pieces
are calld <i>pinnas</i>, which are set upon a frame
over an earthen vessel full of water coverd
with a cap, which they surround with lighted
coals. When the mass grows very hot,
the quicksilver that still remains will come
out in smoke, which having no passage,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
circulates between the mass and the cap,
till descending to the water, it thickens
and sinks to the bottom. Thus the mercury
loses but little, and will serve several
times, tho’ there must be a new supply because
it grows weak with using.</p>

<p>According to <i>Acosta</i>, they use to spend
7000 hundred weight at <i>Potosi</i> in a year:
by which one may judge what vast loads
of silver they got.</p>

<p>When the mercury is quite evaporated,
the silver remains a spongey hollow lump:
and this is calld virgin silver; being pure
and unadulterated. All this according to
law must be carryd to the mint, and pay
the fifth part to his majesty. There the silver
is cast into ingots or bars of different
weight, about a foot long or more. These
bars which have paid the duty can have
no fraud in them, but it may be otherwise
with the <i>pinnas</i> uncast: for the maker often
intermixes iron or lead; therefore they
should all be opend, and tryd by fire, which
would discover another cheat of wetting
them, to make them heavy: for their weight
may be increased near a third part by dipping
them in water, when they are very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
hot. There are also different degrees of
fineness in the same piece, which might
be found out: but the <i>Spaniards</i> not having
convenient places to discover these
frauds, and not caring for it, they e’en let
them go.</p>

<p>There are many sorts of silver ore, according
to the different consistence of the
earth. Some is blackish mixt with iron,
calld <i>nigrillo</i>: another greenish of a copper
mixture, calld <i>cobrisso</i>: some white with
real silver veins, calld <i>plata blanca</i>; and
sometimes the ore is black with lead particles,
this is calld <i>plomo ronco</i>, and is commonly
the best: because instead of kneading
it with quicksilver, it may be melted in
a fornace, and easily parted from the lead.
The old <i>Indians</i> not having, or knowing
the use of mercury, got all their silver from
these sort of mines; and having but little
wood, used to heat their fornaces with the
leaves of plants, and the dung of their sheep:
they made their fornaces upon the mountains,
that the wind might pass thro’ and
keep the fire strong. There is another brown
ore like this last mentiond, where the silver
is not seen at all; but if wetted and rubd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
against iron, it turns ruddy, calld <i>rosicler</i>,
and yields the finest of all silver. There is
another sort calld <i>zaroche</i> which shines like
isinglass; and the <i>paco</i> soft and clayish, but
neither of them valuable. Lastly, there is
a very choice ore found in one of the mines
of <i>Potosi</i> containing many threads of pure
silver, wound up like lumps of burnt lace:
this is calld <i>arana</i>, or spider, being something
like a cobweb.</p>

<p>At <i>Copiapo</i> there are gold mines just behind
the town, and all about the country,
which have brought many purchasers and
workmen thither, to the great damage of
the <i>Indians</i>: for the <i>Spanish</i> magistrates take
away not only their lands, but their horses,
which they sell to the new proprietors, under
pretence of serving the king and improving
the settlement. Here is a great deal of
<i>Magnet</i> and <i>Lapis lazuli</i> which the <i>Indians</i>
know not the value of: and some
leagues in the country there is plenty of
saltpetre, which often lies an inch thick on
the ground. About 100 mile east upon the
<i>Cordileer</i> mountains, there is a vein of sulphur
two foot wide, so fine and pure that it
needs no cleaning. This part of the country
is full of all sorts of mines; but in other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
respects is so barren, that the natives fetch
all their subsistence from <i>Coquimbo</i> and that
way, being a mere desert for 300 mile together:
and the earth abounds so much
with salt and sulphur that the mules often
perish for want of grass and sweet water.
There is but one river in 200 mile, which
the <i>Indians</i> call <i>Ancalulac</i>, or hypocrite, because
it runs only from sun-rise to sun-set.
This is occasiond by the great quantity of
snow melted from the <i>Cordileers</i> in the day
time, which freezes again at night; where
the cold is often so great, that people’s features
are quite distorted. Hence <i>Chili</i> takes
its name, <i>Chile</i> signifying cold in the <i>Indian</i>
language: and we are certainly informd by
the <i>Spanish</i> historians, that some of their
countrymen and others, who first traded this
way, died stiff with cold upon their mules:
for which reason the road is now always
lower along the coast.</p>

<p>The mine countries are all so cold and
barren that the inhabitants get most of their
provision from the coast: this is caused by
the salts and sulphurs exhaled from the earth,
which destroy the seed of all vegetables.
The <i>Spaniards</i> who live thereabout find
them so stifling, that they drink often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
of the <i>mattea</i> to moisten their mouths. The
mules that trip it nimbly over the mountains,
are forced to walk gently about the mines
and stop often to fetch breath. If those vapours
are so strong without, what must they
be within the mine it self, where if a fresh
man goes, he is suddenly benumbd with pain?
and this is the case of many a one; but the
distemper seldom lasts above a day; and
they are not so affected the second time:
But vapours have often burst out so furiously,
that workmen have been killd on the spot:
so that one way or other, multitudes of <i>Indians</i>
die in their calling. To fortify themselves
against the aforesaid steams, they are
continually chewing <i>coca</i>, a herb which is
their common preservative.</p>

<p>An observation occurs here to my memory;
that upon the road to <i>Piura</i>, the
night when we lay down to sleep, our mules
went eagerly to search for a certain root
not unlike a parsnip, tho’ much bigger;
which affords a great deal of juice, and in
such a sandy plain often serves instead of
water: but when the mules are very thirsty,
and they can’t easily rake up the root with
their feet, they will stand over it and bray
till the <i>Indians</i> come to their assistance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>Tho’ the gold mines are more peculiar
to <i>Chili</i>, yet there are one or two washing
places for gold in the south of <i>Peru</i> near
<i>Chili</i>, which I shall now speak of, being the
next thing remarkable. About the year 1709
there were two surprising large lumps of
virgin gold found in one of those places;
one of which weighd thirty two pound
complete, and was purchased by the count
<i>de Moncloa</i> then viceroy of <i>Peru</i> and presented
to the king of <i>Spain</i>. The other
was shaped somewhat like an oxe’s heart. It
weighd twenty two pound and a half, and
was bought by the <i>corregidor</i> of <i>Arica</i>.</p>

<p>To find these <i>lavaderos</i> or washing places,
they dig in the corners of a little brook,
where by certain tokens they judge the
grains of gold to lye. To help carry away
the mud, they let a fresh stream into it,
and keep turning it up, that the current
may send it along. When they are come
to the golden sand, they turn off the stream
another way, and dig with mattocks; and
this earth they carry upon mules to certain
basins joynd together by small chanels. Into
these they let a smart stream of water
to loosen the earth, and carry all the gross
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
part away, the <i>Indians</i> standing in the basins
and throwing out all the stones. The
gold at bottom is still mixt with a black
sand, and hardly to be seen till it is farther
cleard and separated, which is easily
done. But these washing places differ, for
in some there are gold grains as big as bird
shot: and in one belonging to the priests
near <i>Valparaiso</i>, some were found from two
or three ounces to a pound and half weight.
This way of getting gold is much better
than from the mines: here is no need of
iron crows, mills, or quicksilver; so that
both the trouble and expense are much less.
The <i>Creolians</i> are not so curious in washing
their gold as the people in <i>Europe</i>: but
great plenty makes them careless in that
and many other articles.</p>

<p>There are abundance of iron mines in
<i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i>; besides lead, tin and copper,
which the <i>Spaniards</i> intirely neglect,
as not worth their while to work them.
Copper serves for a little kitchen furniture;
but most of their utensils are of silver, even
those for vulgar uses.</p>

<p>About the town of <i>Coquimbo</i> there is
plenty of gold found in the streams that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
come down from the mountains after the
rain showers. These showers are only at
certain times of the year: but if they came
oftner, they would undoubtedly always have
the same effect. And now I speak of <i>Coquimbo</i>,
it would be a fault not to mention
the charms of its scituation. It lies in the
30th degree south, a short mile from the
sea. It stands on a green rising ground
about ten yards high, which nature has regularly
formd like a terras north and south
in a direct line of more than half a mile,
turning at each end to the eastward. The
first street makes a delightful walk, having
the prospect of the country round it, and
the bay before it. All this is sweetly placed
in a valley ever green, and waterd with a
river, which having taken its rise from
among the mountains, flows through the
vales and meadows in a winding stream to
the sea.</p>

<p><i>Baldivia</i>, who built this town in the
year 1544, to serve as a resting place between
<i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i>, pleased with the beauty of
the scituation, and the happiness of the climate,
calld it <i>la Serena</i>; signifying tranquillity
and mildness; which name it deserved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
more than any place in the world. The
whole country puts one in mind of the
poets golden age: there the sharp north
winds never blow; and the heats are fand
with refreshing gales; so that the revolving
year is only spring and autumn joind together.</p>

<p><i>Conception</i> lies six degrees higher in a part
of the country abounding, like <i>Serena</i>, with
all the comforts of life, as well as inestimable
mines of gold. At the king’s station
a little to eastward they have a washing-place,
where they have got <i>pepitas</i> or gold
grains of four pound weight: and these sort
of washes are innumerable, but remain as it
were undiscovered thro’ negligence and incuriosity.
The <i>Cordileer</i> mountains abound
with hardly any thing else but minerals:
this is true of those which have been opend;
and very likely all the rest are so. About 300
miles inwards from <i>Conception</i>, there’s one
hill yields copper so remarkable, that <i>Melendes</i>
who discovered it, found lumps weighing
a hundred quintals a piece, each quintal
being a hundred weight. Mr. <i>Frezier</i>
says he saw one of forty quintals making
into six field pieces, six pounders each. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
are part copper and part stone, which the
inhabitants affirm do all in time breed and
grow intirely to copper. There is another
hill adjoyning which is scarce any
thing but loadstone: and many of them afford
sulphur and salt: About the town it
self there is pit-coal a few foot under ground.
In the year 1510, many mines were found
near the <i>Cordileer</i> mountains, affording at
once gold, silver, copper, iron, lead and tin:
which destroys the notion, that different
metals are never formd together in one
mine.</p>

<p>About twenty mile to the eastward of
<i>Serena</i> are the washing places of <i>Andacol</i>,
whose gold is twenty three carats fine:
and the inhabitants all affirm that after
seventy or eighty years they find them
recruited with gold as plentifully as at
first. And the governer of <i>Coquimbo</i> as
well as others have assured, that on the
mountains the gold mines are so numerous
that, forty or fifty thousand men
might easily be imployd: but for want of
hands, the king of <i>Spain</i> must content himself
without the treasure.

<h2 id="CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.</h2>

<p class="hang"><i>Some account cf the origin of Metals, with
various opinions concerning their formation
in the earth.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> old <i>Creolian Spaniards</i>, and some
others imagine that this plenty of gold
in <i>Chili</i> was occasiond by <i>Noah</i>’s flood, which
threw down the mountains, and broke up
the mines, and washd away the gold into
the lower grounds where it now continues.
But, besides the great probability that that
deluge was only upon the land of <i>Palestine</i>,
<i>Moses</i>’s history on which this fancy is founded,
rather contradicts it; and tells us that
the deluge made very little alteration in the
surface of the earth. Besides, by all the
late discoveries in <i>America</i>, we are convinced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
that the mountains yield more gold
than the rivers. Common rains may send
the gold to the lower parts: for in <i>Chili</i>
the showers that fall from <i>May</i> to <i>September</i>,
are daily making new gutters upon
the hills, which bring down the golden
grains with them.</p>

<p>Without doubt earthquakes have made
great alterations in this part of the world;
some of which, according to several historians,
have changd the scituation of mountains,
and turnd rivers into lakes: and
some authors have supposed that these subversions
have proceded from an inward fermentation,
which has burst open the hills,
and forced the minerals, before they were
duly formd, into the water chanels where
they are so often found. Tho’ this does
not at all answer how metals are formd,
yet great commotions have often happend
in the bowels of the earth, and put many
things out of their natural position; particularly
shells, which in most countries have
been found, sometimes in heaps, and far
enough from the sea where they were first
formd.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>The native <i>Indians</i> believe that gold and
silver breed in the earth without any original
vein; because after certain years the
mines and washing-places have afforded a
perfect new supply; several instances of
which I have before mentiond. And it is
undeniable, that in <i>Chili</i> these <i>lavaderos</i>
are common in the low grounds, where
infinite treasure lies conceald for want of
labourers: for the <i>Spaniards</i> apply chiefly
where the profit is most obvious; and when
any new mine is sprung, they all flock
thither.</p>

<p>I have been informd at <i>Lima</i>, that several
<i>Frenchmen</i>, whose effects were confiscated
by his <i>Spanish</i> majesty’s order for
carrying on an interloping trade between
<i>France</i> and <i>Chili</i>, have thought it better to
stay in the country at any rate than return
home: and so made shift to purchase a
<i>Nigro</i> or two, whom they imployd to fish
for gold in some of these washing places,
which turnd to so good a profit that they
were inabled to settle in <i>Chili</i>. I spoke
with two of them at <i>Conception</i>. They
told me they had but little trouble in doing
of it; that they us’d to watch for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
showers, and then carry only a few sieves to
refine the earth. These places were chiefly
at the small cataracts and water-falls, where
they told me they had often taken up considerable
grains of gold with their hands:
but the <i>corregidors</i> always take care they
shall not grow too rich.</p>

<p>As for metals being formd by the sun;
’tis a weak notion and sufficiently exploded.
About forty years ago a violent lighting
fell on the <i>Illimanni</i> mountain, which
is between <i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i>. Great pieces
and splinters thereof were found scatterd
about the country, and they were all plentifully
veind with gold, tho’ the mountain
is ever known to be coverd with snow.
Therefore that heat which is not strong
enough to thaw the snow, can never be
able to generate and form gold in the
mountain under it.</p>

<p>But as those opinions are most rational,
which are grounded on real discoveries, one
may find out a better way to account for
this thing, than any before mentiond: and
from what has been said, fairly conclude,
that all metals are made and formd by subterraneous
fires, which burn as it were in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
a kiln, conveying their heat far and near
through all the passages of the earth, as
well as the solid mass itself.</p>

<p>These fires are known to be in all the
mine countries of <i>America</i>; and may well
be supposed to dwell in other parts yet unknown.
This intestine heat gives motion
to the salts and sulphurs, being the chief
principles of metals. And tho’ their operation
is incomprehensibly different from
all that we know or practise, yet may we
form a notion, that these spirituous vapours
are forced by fire into the pores of stone;
where being condensed they insinuate themselves
like veins, extend and grow upwards
to the surface.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall now collect some authorities to
confirm the opinion that there are a
race of men in the world calld giants.</p>

<p><i>Don Pedro Molina</i> governer of <i>Chiloe</i>
and several other eye-witnesses have affirmd
that in the country behind the <i>Cordileer</i>
mountains, there is a nation of Indians
calld <i>Caucahues</i>, of an uncommon <i>size</i>,
being near four <i>varas</i> or <i>Spanish</i> yards
high; which is ten foot <i>English</i>. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
are the people antient travelers speak of
calld <i>Patagonians</i>, who live on the eastern
side, about 50 degrees south latitude. I
know this has been taken as a fable, because
many ships going down that way,
have not chanced to see them; the men
who appear on the <i>Patagonian</i> coast and
in <i>Magellan</i> straits being generally of the
common stature: and this is what deceived
<i>Froger</i> in his account of <i>Degennes</i> voyage;
for some ships have seen both sorts at once.</p>

<p>In 1704, captain <i>Harrington</i>’s men belonging
to a ship of St. <i>Malo</i>, saw seven of
these giants in <i>Gregory</i>’s bay. The crew
of the St. <i>Peter</i>, a ship of <i>Marseiles</i> saw
six of the same; among whom there was
one distinguisht from the rest by a net-work
cap that he wore made of birds entrails
stuck round with feathers. Their garments
were skins with the hair inwards; and they
all had bows with cases of arrows: they
helpd the sailors with their boat ashore,
and gave them some of their darts: the
men offerd them bread, brandy and wine;
but they refused them all. The next day
200 of them appeard in a body. These men
they believed were more sensible of the cold,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
tho’ larger than others: for the ordinary
size people along that coast had only a single
skin thrown over their shoulders, whereas
the others were cloathed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption"><i>The following are Mr. <span class="antiqua">Frezier</span>’s words
translated.</i></p>

<p>“What I here deliver on the testimony
of creditable persons, is so agreeable to
what I read in many good voyages; that
’tis my opinion there is much truth in it:
and a man may believe there is a nation of
people in the southermost part of <i>America</i>,
much exceding the common proportion,
without being thought fanciful: the time,
place and circumstances all agreeing, seem
to carry a truth sufficient to overcome
the general opinion to the contrary.
Perhaps the strangeness of the sight may
have caused their size to be somewhat
magnifyd: but if we consider the height
of these men not actually measured, but
only ghest at, we shall find that travelers
differ very little from each other.
To strengthen what I have advanced,
the reader will excuse me if I collect
what I find in various authors upon this
article.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>“<i>Leonardo Argensola</i> in the first chapter
of his history of the <i>Molucca</i> islands,
says that the same <i>Magellan</i>, in the straits
that bears his name, took some men who
were fifteen spans, that is eleven foot
high: but they soon pined away and died.
In the third chapter he says that <i>Sarmiento</i>’s
men fought with some of these
people, who were above three <i>Spanish</i>
yards high, that is above eight foot. They
repulsed the <i>Spaniards</i> once: but being
attackt the second time, they took to
their heels and run at so great a rate, that
according to the <i>Spanish</i> saying, a bullet
would not overtake them.</p>

<p>“There is something like this in <i>Sibald
Dewert</i>’s voyage 1559, who being at anchor
in the <i>Green-Bay</i> in <i>Magellan</i> straits
with five ships, saw seven <i>Indian</i> imbarkations
full of giants; who they ghest
were ten or eleven foot high. The
<i>Dutchmen</i> fired at them and drove them
ashore, but they were so terrifyd at the
fire arms, that they tore up the trees to
shelter themselves from the musket balls.</p>

<p>“<i>Oliver North</i>, who came there a few
months after <i>Dewert</i>, tells us that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
saw giants ten or twelve foot high: tho’
he had seen other men of the common
size.</p>

<p>“<i>Spilbergen</i>, as he enterd <i>Magellan</i> straits
in 1615, saw on <i>Terra del fogo</i> a man of
surprizing height got upon a rising ground
to see the ships go by.</p>

<p>“<i>Shouten</i> in the same year being in
<i>Port Desire</i>, his men went ashore and
found heaps of stones laid in such a form
that they had a mind to see what was under
them: and they found bones of a
human body between ten and eleven
foot long, that is nine or ten <i>English</i>
measure; to which measure <i>North</i>’s account
and <i>Dewert</i>’s must be reduced.</p>

<p>“Other authorities as well living as dead
might be brought to justify this relation:
and tho’ some people have doubted it,
yet the several testimonies aforementiond,
joind with the account of giants which we
have in holy scripture, should incline us
to receive it for truth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Frezier</i> has a notion that the <i>Almighty</i>
framed at first three different colors of men;
<i>white</i>, <i>black</i> and the dark <i>copper</i>, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
last is the hue of all the <i>Indians</i> in <i>America</i>:
and tho’ the holy scripture is silent as to
the origin of these, yet he doubts not that
the <i>Nigros</i> or <i>Blacks</i> are children of <i>Cush
Noah</i>’s grandson, which is an <i>African</i> word
and signifies black. But however piously
affected he and others may be to that divine
history, it is impossible this way to
account for the originals of people; or even
conjecture how this great extended continent
was first planted: and without admitting <i>Preadamites</i>
we shall meet with endless absurdities.
<i>Grotius</i>, who was hardly inferior
to any man in wit and learning, rather than
disallow mankind’s beginning with <i>Adam</i>,
would have it that <i>America</i> was peopled
from <i>Norway</i>. The <i>Norwegians</i> planted
<i>Iceland</i>; from thence came the <i>Greenlanders</i>,
who overspread the north-west islands; and
so at last all <i>America</i> came to be peopled.
But when one comes to consider, that the
<i>Americans</i> are no more like the <i>Norwegians</i>
than the <i>Nigros</i> are like the <i>Indians</i>;
and that in all respects the natives of this
new world are quite different from the
other, that reasoning of <i>Grotius</i> is weak
and insufficient: and had he lived to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
the <i>Danish</i> account of the <i>Greenlanders</i> with
other north discoveries, it would have confounded
him; Moreover ’tis certain that
the <i>Chilians</i> never lived in a social manner
like other nations, but in single
families only; nor have they any ideas
of God or religion in any kind, or the being
of a soul, all which they make a jest
of. And tho’ it is said, that at the conquest
of these countries the <i>Spaniards</i> found
golden and other images in <i>Peru</i>, which
the <i>Indians</i> used to worship; yet it’s probable
they were made only to represent
some of their kings, whose memory they
held in great veneration. But as this subject
requires a separate treatise rather than
a place in this book, I shall procede in my
other design. And I am persuaded that there
must be some more divine influence than
the example and arguments of the priesthood,
to produce among the <i>Indians</i> so
good as an effect a true belief of the <i>Gospel</i>.

<h2 id="CHAP_V">CHAP. V.</h2>

<p class="caption"><i>Observations on the <span class="antiqua">Chili</span> trade.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> town of <i>St. Malo</i> has always
been noted for good privatiers. They
annoyd the <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i> very much
in their trade during the whole reign of
king <i>William</i>, and part of queen <i>Anne</i>:
and tho’ some religious-headed people fancy
that money got by privatiering won’t prosper,
yet I may venture to say the St. <i>Malo</i>
men are as rich and florishing as any people
in <i>France</i>. It has thrived so well with
them, that all their <i>South Sea</i> trade is owing
to their privatiering; and in the late
war they were so generous, that they made
several free gifts to <i>Lewis</i> XIV. And tho’
our <i>English Admiralty</i> always kept a stout
squadron cruising in the <i>Atlantic</i> ocean,
yet we never took one of their <i>South-Seamen</i>;
and my reason for it is this, they
kept their ships extremely clean, having
ports to careen at which we did not think
of. For in the year 1709, when I belongd
to his majesty’s ship the <i>Loo</i>, being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
one of the convoys that year to <i>Newfoundland</i>,
we saw upon that coast a 50 gun
ship, which we chased, and soon discoverd
she was <i>French</i> built; but she crowded sail
and left us in a very little time. She had
just been cleand at <i>Placentia</i>: and we might
well wonder to find such a ship in that part
of the world, but were afterwards informd
by <i>French</i> prisoners that she was a <i>South-Seaman</i>
bound to St. <i>Malo</i>, with two or
three million of dollars aboard; and was
then so trim, that she trusted to her heels
and valued no body. By their going so
far to westward and northward withal, they
had the advantage of westerly winds, which
seldom faild of sending them into soundings
at one spirt, if not quite home. But
since <i>Placentia</i> has been yielded to <i>Great
Britain</i>, they now make use of St. <i>Catharine</i>,
the island <i>Grande</i> on the coast of
<i>Brasil</i>, and <i>Martinico</i> in the <i>West Indies</i>.</p>

<p>This trade succeded so well that they all
fell into it, sending every year a matter of
twenty sail of ships: I my self saw eleven
sail together on the coast of <i>Chili</i> in the
year 21: among which were several of
50 guns, and one that would mount 70
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
calld the <i>Flower de Lis</i>, formerly a man
of war. All this being contrary to the
<i>Assiento</i> treaty between <i>Spain</i> and <i>Great
Britain</i>, frequent memorials were presented
at <i>Madrid</i>: and the king of <i>Spain</i> willing
to keep up his ingagements with <i>England</i>,
resolved to gratify the <i>British</i> court
by destroying the <i>French</i> trade to the <i>South-Sea</i>.
His <i>Catholic</i> majesty knew there was
no way to do this, but by a squadron of
men of war. He knew likewise that few
of his own subjects were acquainted with
the navigation of <i>Cape Horne</i>, or could
bear the extreme rigor of the climate:
therefore was obliged to make use of foreigners
for this expedition; and three of
the four ships that he sent were mand with
and commanded by <i>Frenchmen</i>, according
to the old saying, Set a thief to catch a
thief.</p>

<p>The first was the <i>Glocester</i> of 50 guns
and 400 men, formerly an <i>English</i> man of
war: the second was the <i>Ruby</i> 50 guns
and 350 men another <i>English</i> ship: the
third was a fregat of 40 guns and 200
men: the fourth was the <i>Leon Franco</i>, a
<i>Spanish</i> man of war of 60 guns and 450
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
men all <i>Spaniards</i>. <i>Monsieur Martinet</i> a
<i>French</i> gentleman was commodore of this
squadron, and commanded the <i>Glocester</i>:
<i>Monsieur La Jonquiere</i> had the <i>Ruby</i>; the
rest I forget. The <i>French</i> performd their
navigation well enough, and got round the
<i>Cape</i> tho’ it was in the middle of winter:
but the last of the four being <i>Spaniards</i>,
after several attempts, could not weather
<i>Cape Horne</i>, but was forced by utter necessity
to bear away back to the river of <i>Plate</i>,
where at last the ship was unfortunately
cast away.</p>

<p>It looks here as if an experiment was
made to see if the <i>Spaniards</i> were hardy
enough to go through that terrible navigation:
but as they have little or no trade
into any cold climates, and unused to hard
work, ’tis no wonder they faild in that
point. The <i>Biscayners</i> indeed are robust
fellows enough, and if the <i>Leon Franco</i>
had been mand with them, she had certainly
doubled the cape with the other
three ships: but the <i>Spaniards</i> in general,
ever since their possessions in <i>America</i>, are
grown so delicate and indolent, that it
would be hard to find an intire ship’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
company able to perform that navigation.</p>

<p>The great advantage of the trade of
<i>Chili</i> this way is so manifest, that his <i>Catholic</i>
majesty is obliged by treaties to shut
out all nations from it as well as the <i>English</i>,
tho’ he makes nothing of it himself:
and it’s very rare that a <i>Spanish</i> ship has
gone by <i>Cape Horne</i>. From hence arises
the extraordinary price all <i>European</i> goods
fetch at <i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i>: I have been told
at <i>Lima</i> that they often are sold at 400
<i>per cent.</i> profit; and I may say the goods
that are carryd from <i>France</i> by <i>Cape Horne</i>
are in themselves 50 <i>per cent.</i> better than
those that go in the <i>Flota</i> from <i>Cales</i> to
<i>Cartagena</i>, or <i>La vera Cruz</i>: because the
former are delivered fresh and undamaged
in six months; whereas the other are generally
eighteen months before they can
come to <i>Chili</i>: so that the <i>French</i>, during
the foresaid interloping trade, made their
markets, furnishd themselves with provision,
and got home again in twelve or fourteen
months time.</p>

<p>When <i>Martinet</i> arrived at <i>Chili</i>, in the
year 17, with the king of <i>Spain</i>’s commission
to take or destroy all his countrymen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
that were trading there clandestinly, he soon
found imployment for his three ships, the
fourth being lost as aforesaid. And of
fourteen sail of St. <i>Malo</i> men there was
but one escaped him; she being landlockt
in a little creek, where she lay hid till he was
got to leeward: after which she weighd
and came away with half her cargo unsold.</p>

<p>Tho’ all this was to execute the orders
of his <i>Catholic</i> majesty, and doing a sensible
pleasure to the <i>British South-Sea</i> company:
yet the <i>Creole Spaniards</i>, especially
the trading part of them, found themselves
almost ruind by it; because it hinderd the
circulation of money, and spoild business,
so that they could not bear the sight of
the <i>French</i> men of War, tho’ they liked the
<i>French</i> merchantmen well enough. On the
other hand, the <i>French</i> imagining they had
done the <i>Spaniards</i> effectual service, expected,
no doubt, civil treatment while they
stayd among them. But as soon as <i>Martinet</i>
brought his prizes into <i>Callao</i>, and
the <i>Frenchmen</i> had received their proper
shares, they forgetting the old antipathy of
the <i>Spanish</i> to the <i>French</i> nation, gave themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
extravagant airs ashore by frisking
and drinking that still incensed the <i>Creolians</i>
more against them, who calld them
<i>Gavachos</i> and <i>Renegados</i> for falling foul on
their own countrymen. From one thing
or other their mutual quarels grew so high
that the <i>Frenchmen</i> were forced to go in
parties about <i>Lima</i> and <i>Callao</i>, the better
to oppose public outrages and affronts. At
last a young gentleman, who was ensign
aboard the <i>Ruby</i> and nephew to captain
<i>Jonquiere</i>, was shot from a window in one
of these frays; and the malefactor took sanctuary
in the great church at <i>Callao</i>. <i>Martinet</i>,
<i>Jonquiere</i> and the other captain join
in a petition to the viceroy, that the murderer
may be deliverd to justice: but the
viceroy being an archbishop would by no
means violate mother church to humour
any body. Upon which they orderd all
their men aboard by public beat of drum,
and brought their three ships with their
broadsides to bear on the town of <i>Callao</i>;
threatning to demolish the houses and fortification,
unless the rogue was deliverd up
or executed. All this blustering could not
prevail with the viceroy to give them any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
satisfaction, tho’ they had several other men
killd beside the gentleman. At last <i>Jonquiere</i>
unwilling to use extremities, and no
longer able to bear the place where his nephew
was murderd; obtaind of his commodore
<i>Martinet</i>, that he might make the
best of his way home.</p>

<p>About this time many fathers and other
rich passengers were got together at the
town of <i>Conception</i>, intending when this
squadron came by, to take their passage to
<i>Europe</i>: for they knew that all ships bound
by <i>Cape Horne</i> must touch at <i>Conception</i>, or
thereabouts, for provision. Herein <i>Jonquiere</i>
got the whip hand of his commodore
having now the advantage of so many good
passengers in his ship; for as the king of
<i>Spain</i> has no officers at <i>Conception</i> to register
the money shipt there, so it’s unknown
what great sums these passengers and missionaries
put on board the <i>Ruby</i>. The reason
why there are no such officers, is because
’tis not worth while, all the money
going the north way to come home in the
<i>Flota</i>.</p>

<p>By this opportunity the <i>padres</i> and others
gaind two great advantages; first they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
spared the trouble of a voyage to <i>Panama</i>
or <i>Acapulco</i>; and thence traversing the continent
to <i>Portobello</i> or <i>La vera cruz</i>, where
they must expect to have had their coffers
visited to see if the <i>Indulto</i> to his Majesty
was fairly accounted for. And then they
saved every shilling of the said indulto or
duty, because the <i>Ruby</i> touchd first in <i>France</i>,
where no cognisance at all was to be taken
of the affair. So that as they saved one
moiety of the duty payable in <i>America</i>, they
likewise got clear of the other payable in
<i>Spain</i>, because the ship arrived in <i>France</i>
where they put all their money ashore.</p>

<p>There was on board the <i>Ruby</i> beside these
passengers money, a considerable sum arising
to his <i>Catholic</i> majesty from the confiscation
of the thirteen interlopers taken
by this squadron. All which together I was
well informd amounted to four million of
dollars aboard that ship. What a fine booty
then have we missd, thro’ <i>Shelvocke</i>’s obstinate
conduct? For when this same ship
<i>Ruby</i> found us in the harbour of St. <i>Catherine</i>;
<i>Jonquiere</i>’s company, as I said in
my first section, were so infirm, that he
had not more than sixty well men in 400
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
souls: so that he really was afraid of us;
and would not even send his boat ashore to
the watering place, where we kept guard,
and our coopers and sailmakers were at
work, till he had first askd our captain leave.
Nor is this at all strange, for understanding
we had a consort, he was really in pain all
the time he was there, lest the <i>Success</i>
should come in: and if <i>Shelvocke</i> had not
wilfully lost company with <i>Clipperton</i>, and
perversly determined never to joyn him,
which he might have done at <i>Canarie</i>, there
is probability enough that we should have
met with <i>Jonquiere</i> at sea, if not at <i>St. Catherine</i>:
then our business had been done
for this time without going any farther:
and we were certainly able as it was, to
carry the <i>Ruby</i> our selves, had we known
her condition.</p>

<p>After captain <i>Martinet</i> had cleard the
coasts of <i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i> of his countrymen;
he sent express with the news to <i>Madrid</i> his
brother in law <i>monsieur de Grange</i>, who came
by way of <i>Portobello</i>, <i>Jamaica</i> and <i>London</i>.
Upon delivering his message the king askd
him, what he should do for him. <i>De Grange</i>
humbly beggd, that his majesty would please
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
to give him the command of a ship to go
round <i>cape Horne</i> again. He accordingly
had the <i>Zelerin</i> of fifty guns. He came first
to <i>Cales</i> where the ship was getting ready,
but was surprizd to find a very cold reception
from the <i>French</i> merchants and other
gentlemen of his acquaintance residing there,
for as there were merchants of several nations
interested in the ships taken and confiscated
as aforesaid, they unanimously lookd
upon him and all the <i>French</i> aboard that
squadron to be false brethren for serving a
foreign power to the prejudice of their own
countrymen: and while he expected a valuable
cargo consignd to himself, being what
he aimd at, he found himself quite disappointed;
for no man would ship the value
of a dollar with him.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Fitzgerald</i> who was then at
<i>Cales</i> seeing this, made him a considerable
proposal for the privilege of going his next
officer, and to take aboard what goods he
could procure in his own name. <i>De Grange</i>
being a little imbarrast accepted the offer,
and obtaind from court a commission for
him as second captain. Accordingly they
mand the <i>Zelerin</i> chiefly with <i>French</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
some <i>English</i> seamen; and away they went,
getting very well round the <i>cape</i>. When
our two privatiers <i>Success</i> and <i>Speedwel</i> were
known to be in the <i>South-Sea</i>, this same
ship <i>Zelerin</i> was one of those commissiond
by the viceroy of <i>Peru</i> to cruise for us.
<i>Fitzgerald</i> sold his goods at <i>Lima</i> to great
advantage, where he continued, while <i>De
Grange</i> served as captain under the admiral
<i>Don Pedro Midranda</i> who took me and
the rest of us prisoners.</p>

<p>The <i>St. Malo</i> merchants, tho’ great sufferers
by so many confiscations, were not
much discouraged; for in the year 20, we
found the <i>Solomon</i> of <i>St. Malo</i> carrying
40 guns and 150 men at <i>Hilo</i> on the coast
of <i>Chili</i> with several small <i>Spanish</i> barks
at her stern. She sold her cargo in six
weeks time, got a fresh supply of provision
and left the coast without interruption;
for by this time <i>Martinet</i>’s squadron was
all come away. The <i>Solomon</i>’s good success
gave them such incouragement that they
immediately fitted out fourteen sail together;
all which arrived in the <i>South-Sea</i>
beginning the year 1721: three of whose
commanders having the best acquaintance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
among the <i>Creolians</i>, quickly sold their cargos
and returnd home.</p>

<p>About this time the people of <i>Lima</i> judged
the <i>English</i> privatiers were gone off the
coast, at least that no more hostilities would
be committed, because of the truce made
between the two crowns. Whereupon the
three <i>Spanish</i> men of war fitted out chiefly
to cruise on us, were orderd against these
fresh interlopers. I was on board the <i>Advice</i>
boat calld the <i>Flying Fish</i> in company
with the said three men of war, when they
came up with the eleven sail of <i>St. Malo</i>
men altogether on the coast of <i>Chili</i>; and
instead of firing upon them, the <i>Spaniards</i>
joynd them like friends. The <i>French</i> expecting
to be attackt, kept all together in
a line and dared the men of war to begin.
This to me seemd new, that three such ships
purposely fitted for this cruise, should on
their own coast decline doing their duty:
for had they proved too weak they had ports
of their own under their lee. In short,
the men of war contented themselves to
watch the others motion, keeping them always
in sight: and when any of the <i>French</i>
ships steerd to the shore, the <i>Spaniards</i> sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
their pinnace or long boat with the <i>Spanish</i>
flag hoisted; the sight of which effectually
deterrd the <i>Creoles</i> from treating or trading
with the <i>French</i>. Thus they made shift to
hinder all these ships disposing of their
goods: except they were met by chance at
sea and sold some clandestinely. At length,
being tired out, the <i>Frenchmen</i> got leave
to take in provision, and went home with
at least half their goods unsold. Notwithstanding
all this and the severe edicts against
it in <i>France</i>, I know they still continue
the trade, tho’ privately: nor is it probable
they will ever leave off so sweet a commerce,
except some other power prevent it.</p>

<p>With these remarks I shall bring this book
to a conclusion; having indeavourd through
the whole, to make all the subjects agreeable:
even the controversial part of it, as
it was unavoidable, I hope is inoffensive.
After all my difficulties and sufferings, my
personal pain and anxiety of mind, I have
one pleasure remaining; which is gratefully
to thank those gentlemen who used me and
my ship-mates with great kindness and generosity
while it was our fate to be confined
in so remote a part of the world.

<p>Thus have I led my reader through the
voyage.&mdash;When I first thought of this work,
I intended only to clear my self from the
infamous reflexions of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>;
but being authorised by men of worth and
distinction, I determined not only to justify
my self and fellow-sufferers, but to
give this full account of the whole expedition:
for <i>Shelvocke</i>’s is no account of the
voyage at all, but a libel invented to give
a gloss to all his evil actions, and blind
those who knew nothing of the story. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
tho’ the undertaking proved abortive, ’tis
fit mankind should know the true reason of
it, and not be deceived with base accounts
to palliate base actions. Neither do I think
it should be any discouragement to a future
subscription of this kind; for the mistakes
in this voyage may be of great use to others,
tho’ they have ruind some of us, and been
injurious to all.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>An <span class="antiqua"><em class="gesperrt">ACCOUNT</em></span> of the <span class="smcap"><span class="antiqua"><em class="gesperrt">Jesuits</em></span></span>
settlement in the province of <span class="antiqua">Paraguay</span>
in south <span class="antiqua">America</span>.</i> (<i>translated
from the <span class="antiqua">French</span>.</i>)</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_325b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Tho’</span> many of the <i>European</i> powers
have planted colonies in <i>America</i>
since the <i>Spanish</i> conquest, yet there
never was in any country one so remarkable,
as the settlement of the jesuits in <i>Paraguay</i>:
The beginning of it was only about fifty families
of <i>Indians</i>, which these fathers collected
together, and seated in the middle of
the country: since which it has multiplyd
so fast, that there are now 300,000 families;
which at the usual computation is two
million of souls. These possess some of the
finest land on all the continent, lying along
the river <i>Paraguay</i>, between twenty and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
thirty degrees south latitude; 600 mile
north of <i>Buenos Ayres</i>; as much to the
south of the <i>Portuguese Paulists</i>, and 400
from the province of <i>Tucuman</i>: being separated
from <i>Chili</i> by the <i>Cordileer</i> mountains.</p>

<p>The jesuits have not been able yet to carry
their mission farther among the <i>Indians</i> for
want of more fathers: otherwise they could
take in 5 or 600 mile of as good pasturage
as the world affords. But the country they
now possess is as fruitful as any, and as well
waterd; having their meadows full of sheep
and black cattle. They have also stock
enough of timber, corn, indigo, flax, cotton,
sugar, pulse and fruit: and what excels
all this, they have mines of gold and
silver tho’ the good fathers won’t own it:
however, there have been so many proofs
of it, that it is now indisputable.</p>

<p>The natives are good humourd, tractable
and laborious; and by management of the
jesuits learn all useful trades. They are divided
into forty two parishes, which like
towns lye five, ten and twenty mile asunder.
Every parish has a <i>Padre</i> for their sovereign,
who is obeyd with exact fear and respect.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
He punishes every crime as he thinks fit: so
that he is both their absolute priest and king.</p>

<p>The common discipline is a certain number
of stripes with a whip, according to the
nature of the transgression. The magistrates
whom they put in under them, are not
excused from the same punishment: but
which is very particular, he that is soundly
flogd comes humbly and kisses the father’s
sleeve, owns his fault and thanks him for
the chastisement. And this is the way one
man governs seven or eight thousand families:
so that there never was a more complete
dominion, or a more passive, obedient
people.</p>

<p>The same method is not only observed
in all the parishes, but is also attended with
perfect satisfaction of mind. The <i>Indians</i>
are content with food and rayment; and
happy in their condition, tho’ the jesuits intirely
reap the fruit of all their labour. They
are taught to expect the felicities of another
life, and stedfastly believe the reverend fathers
have the distribution of that happiness.
There are warehouses in each parish, where
the people carry all their manufacture, goods
and provision: for they must not eat a chicken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
of their own, without it comes in their daily
allowance.</p>

<p>Next let it be considerd what vast profit
these sovereign ecclesiastics make of the
work of such a multitude of hands.  If it
is only allowd that each family brings them
clear three pound a year: the total produce
of 300,000 families will be nine hundred
thousand pound <i>per annum</i>. Then consider
the trade they have to all <i>Chili</i>, <i>Peru</i> and
<i>Mexico</i> for the herb <i>Camini</i>, or <i>Paraguay</i>
tea; where a prodigious quantity is drank,
and at a moderate computation brings them
200,000 pound a year, (all <i>East-India</i>
tea being there prohibited.) Their other
commodities must be likewise sold to good
advantage; and the gold dust which the <i>Indians</i>
gather up from the washes, when
the river waters have left them, is an unknown
revenue. Nevertheless, these fathers
will tell ye, their gospel mission costs
them a great deal of money and pains, and
that their income is inconsiderable: but the
jesuits gold and silver coind and uncoind,
which comes every now and then into <i>Europe</i>,
the shining magnificence of their
churches, and their commerce, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
known to all the <i>Spaniards</i> as well as others,
are demonstrations to the contrary.</p>

<p>’Tis not amiss here to describe the church
and habitation of one of those fathers, as
it was related by two <i>Frenchmen</i> belonging
to a ship of <i>Nants</i> commanded by
<i>monsieur d’Escaseau</i>.</p>

<p>When that ship set sail from the port
of <i>Maldonad</i> designing for <i>France</i>, the said
two <i>Frenchmen</i> happend to be ashore; and
at so great a distance, that when they came
down the boat was gone off without them.
One of these was captain of the small arms,
and the other a serjeant. Being at a loss
what to do on a desert coast, they resolved
to advance up the country, and live upon
what their muskets would bring them. In
three days they met <i>Indians</i> with beads round
their necks, who kindly received them; and,
understanding they were <i>French</i>, made many
signs of respect: for they are taught to love
that nation and distinguish them from all
others.</p>

<p>They led them up to the <i>Mission</i>, several
days journey from the place where they met;
and in their way lived upon wild cows,
which the <i>Indians</i> catch when they please,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
by throwing a noose at ten or fifteen yards
distance so cleverly round their horns, that
they easily come to: which done, they
hamstring them and cut their throats.</p>

<p>The <i>Frenchmen</i> being arrived at the <i>Mission</i>,
were handsomly entertaind by the jesuit,
lord of that parish; at whose apartment
they stayd four months without going
once abroad. After this they returnd to
<i>Buenos Ayres</i> under a guard of <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>The account they gave is as follows.
That <i>Father</i>’s parish church is long and spacious,
enterd by a portico of several handsome
steps; and supported by eight columns
of a good order and well wrought. Over
the door within is a gallery for the music
in divine service, which consists of sixty persons,
voices and instruments. There are
seats in the church, where the men are
placed according to their seniority and office:
the women sitting in a neat gallery
by themselves. The great altar is defended
by a ballustrade of <i>India</i> wood curiously
turnd. The military officers are placed on
the right, and the <i>Caciques</i> or civil magistrates,
on the left.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>The back of the altar is very richly coverd.
In the middle are three large paintings,
framed with solid gold and silver. Above
these are several gravings, and <i>base
relieves</i> in gold. The top is finisht with
wood-work richly wrought and gilt up to
the roof. On either side the altar is a
wooden pedestal, plated at top with gold,
upon which stand two saints of solid silver.
The tabernacle is gilt with gold; and the
<i>pyx</i> wherein the host is kept is of solid gold,
set round with emeralds and other costly
stones. The ends and foot of the altar are
hung with brocades fringed with gold. In
short, the candlesticks and other vessels of
plate, with which the altar is drest in service
time amidst a great number of wax-lights,
make a splendor beyond expression.</p>

<p>There are two small altars, on the right
and left of the church, adornd in proportion
to the other: and in the middle towards
the ballustrade, is a large silver candlestick
of thirty gilt branches, hanging from
the roof by a silver chain. By all which a
man may form some idea of the riches of
that settlement, if the other parishes are like
this, which is very rational to believe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>The <i>presbytery</i> or father’s dwelling consists
of several rooms and a hall furnisht with
images and pictures, where the <i>Indians</i> wait
the good father’s levee till he comes forth
to give audience. These lodgings are surrounded
with green walks, gardens, and
out-houses for servants. The whole with
the church making a large noble square and
walld in.</p>

<p>The forty two jesuits are independent of
each other’s government; and are answerable
to no power on earth, but the principal of
the convent of <i>Cordova</i> in <i>Tucuman</i>; who
makes a general visitation once a year through
the <i>Mission</i>, attended by a numerous guard
of horse. When he arrives at the parish,
the <i>Indians</i> are to shew all respect and joy.
The magistrates approach him with fear,
and a down cast head; while the common
people kneel, and cross their hands as he
passes along. While he stays in the <i>Mission</i>,
every parish makes up the last year’s
account of their whole expense and income.</p>

<p>All their merchandizes are carryd by water
to <i>Santa Fe</i>, which being their great
magazine, they keep there a general factor.
from thence they are carryd to <i>Buenos</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
<i>Ayres</i> by land; where they appoint another
factor. From these chief towns they dispose
of their goods to the chapmen of <i>Peru</i>, <i>Chili</i>,
and the three provinces of <i>Paraguay</i>, <i>Buenos
Ayres</i> and <i>Tucuman</i>. And we may justly
conclude, that this <i>Mission</i> of jesuits carries
on more trade than the three provinces
together.</p>

<p>The business of the civil officers is to
write down the number of families, visit
their houses, overlook their work, and deliver
the jesuits orders. And as kissing the
father’s sleeve is counted an earnest of their
future immortal happiness, this welcome
kiss is promised them as a reward in this
life for doing their duty and minding their
work. There are other task-masters for the
country, to whom they strictly declare the
produce of every thing, even to an egg; and
are obliged, under certain penalties, to carry
all into the proper store-houses. Servants
also are appointed to parcel out to each family
twice a week their allowance of provision:
which is done with surprizing order
in the father’s presence. And tho’ these
priests are sufficiently paid for their care and
vigilance; yet, to their praise it must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
ownd, they are indefatigable in their labor,
to prevent the people murmuring or
misimploying their time. Formerly two jesuits
were in each parish; but since their
great increase there is only one, till they
get more from <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> are not sufferd to drink
wine, or any spirituous liquor. Herein the
good priests copy the law of <i>Mahomet</i>, who
likewise forbid his disciples the use of wine;
lest being spirited up, they should rebel,
shake off their yoke, and overturn the empire
he had founded.</p>

<p>The jesuits marry their men and women
young, to fulfil perhaps the first commandment
given to <i>Adam</i>, <i>Increase</i> and <i>multiply</i>,
or for other wise ends. The first precepts
the children learn, are to fear God and the
jesuit; to be humble and patient, and not
in love with this world.</p>

<p>As the civil government is well orderd,
so is the military. Every parish according
to its power, is obliged to maintain some
regiments of horse and foot. Each regiment
hath six companies of fifty men with proper
officers, and an adjutant who exercises them
every sunday evening. Those officers are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
traind up from father to son; so that the
military discipline becomes natural, and
their forces march in great order. For this
reason the parishes have all an easy communication,
that their army may soon be
formd under their proper commanders, of
whom one of the jesuits is generalissimo.
Their small arms are swords, muskets and
slings; which last being natural to them,
they can throw heavy stones; and hit a
mark at a great distance.</p>

<p>The whole <i>Mission</i> can draw together
60,000 men in a week’s time. Their pretense
for keeping up so great a number is,
because the <i>Portuguese Paulists</i> sometimes
make excursions and take away their people:
but the <i>Spaniards</i> laugh at this, well knowing
that the jesuits keep these standing forces
to prevent any foreign power giving disturbance
to their colony.</p>

<p>Their omitting to teach the <i>Indians</i> the
<i>Spanish</i> tongue, and forbiding them to converse
at all with that nation when they are
sometimes sent to work in the towns for
the king of <i>Spain</i>’s service, is plain they mean
to keep their government to themselves.
For when any stranger, as these two <i>Frenchmen</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
are driven there by accident, they are
shut up while they stay. And when the <i>Spaniards</i>
themselves passing up the river <i>Paraguay</i>
have occasion to touch upon their
settlement, they dare not go beyond their
church walls: and when they beg leave to
see the town, the jesuit is sure to walk with
them, and all the <i>Indians</i> are taught to keep
in, and shut their doors. They have other
precautions, one of which is, to send out
good detachments of troops to clear their
frontiers from <i>St. Gabriel</i>’s isles to the <i>Maldonad</i>
hills, and hinder all communication
with their country, for the sake of their
gold and silver mines; of which we shall
give two instances. The <i>Falmouth</i> of <i>St.
Malo</i> being lost in 1706 near the <i>Flores</i>
islands, some of these troops plunderd part
of her cargo; which they afterwards restored
by the interposition of the governer
of <i>Buenos Ayres</i>. Two years after this,
the <i>Atlas</i> was cast away at the <i>Castiles</i>,
and the crew having saved some of their
best effects, were marching over the country
to the <i>Maldonades</i>, thinking to get home
again by sea; but were met by the <i>Indians</i>,
who took all from them. However, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
had luckily buryd their silver upon the coast,
to the value of several thousand dollars,
which they afterwards took along with
them.</p>

<p>At the foot of the <i>Maldonad</i> mountains
are good mines, which were discoverd by
<i>Pacheco</i>, who lived at <i>Buenos Ayres</i> and
was formerly miner of <i>Potosi</i> in <i>Peru</i>: they
are about seventy mile from the port, and
forty from <i>Montevide</i>. The governer of
<i>Buenos Ayres</i> being acquainted with it, sent
workmen with <i>Pacheco</i>, who dug up the
place and returnd with a good quantity of
gold ore. But <i>Valdes Inelau</i> the governer
being bribed by the father of the <i>Mission</i>,
gave out that he had made trial of the ore,
and it would not answer the charge and
trouble. However <i>Pacheco</i> kept what he
had got, and saw it was only a trick of the
jesuits, to prevent any new settlement near
their dominions.</p>

<p>Some of the said ore was lately tryd in
<i>France</i>, but yielded little, being taken from
neat the surface. But <i>Pacheco</i>, who is known
to be as good a miner as any, says, there
is no richer earth in <i>America</i> than that
place affords: and doubts not the rivers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
thereaway are fertile of gold dust, as those
near the <i>Paulists</i>. The young <i>Indians</i> in
the parish of <i>St. Dominic</i>, have several
times brought gold to <i>Buenos Ayres</i>, which
they got privately from the <i>Mission</i>; from
whence we may infer there is a good deal
of it.</p>

<p>In the year 1706, the aforesaid <i>D’Escaseau</i>,
being in <i>Maldonad</i> port, met with
some of these <i>Indians</i>, who came in a small
detachment to drive some cattle up to the
<i>Mission</i>. He talkd with them, and made
them a present. In return, they told him
if he would go up the country to a place
they pointed at, he might get silver enough.
The priests have all along been jealous, lest
the <i>Spaniards</i> should find any of these mines,
because a settlement of that kind might be
of dangerous consequence: and they have
taken care to clear the country on that
side of all cattle and provision whatsoever.</p>

<p>From the foregoing particulars, ’tis evident
that the jesuits affect sovereignty and
arbitrary rule; and the three chief objects
of their desire are power, splendor and
riches. Their method of educating and
governing their people, from whose industry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
arises all they enjoy, allowing them the
bare necessaries of life; their care to prevent
any communication with the <i>Spaniards</i>;
their caution when any stranger comes
to their <i>Mission</i> by accident; their standing
forces, and scowring their borders to prevent
any new settlement near their limits;
are all manifest arguments that they design
to continue independent: and not only
conceal what revenues they have, but many
other advantages they are not yet quite possest
of.</p>

<p>Some casuists will say, that all these nations
round <i>Paraguay</i> belong to his <i>Spanish</i>
majesty as king of the <i>Indies</i>; <i>Paraguay</i> it
self being possest by the <i>Spaniards</i> in 1540,
and governd by the viceroy of <i>Peru</i>. According
to these gentlemen, the true divine
right is the right of conquest: so that all
these <i>Indians</i> are his natural born subjects,
and should obey him alone. They ought
freely to parcel out their land, and dispose
of their own crop, and otherwise injoy the
fruit of their labor, whether in the mines
or manufactures: this would make it a regular
colony, and cause a general circulation
of trade and money. Doubtless the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
poor <i>Indians</i> would be glad of all this:
but the wise fathers argue a different way,
That since they have got them under subjection,
and brought them into great rule
and order, they have at present a fair title
to their allegiance: especially since all this
is done without cruelty or force of arms.
’Tis true, the <i>Indians</i> can call nothing their
property, but give up all as the inheritance
of two and forty ecclesiastical kings ruling
two million of good natured loyal subjects.</p>

<p>We shall give one instance of the great
authority of these fathers, and the duty of
their people. When the governer of <i>Buenos
Ayres</i> was orderd to besiege St. Gabriel belonging
to the <i>Portuguese</i>, a body of 4000
jesuit <i>Indians</i> came to assist him. After lying
a short time before the town, the said
governer orderd the attack at four in the
morning. The <i>Indians</i> not receiving their
orders from their own commander, refused
to obey; and threatend to revolt: whereupon
the right reverend general was acquainted
with it, who not being yet come
from his tent, made haste to the army, and put
himself at the head of his forces: when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
<i>Indians</i> immediately formd themselves, and
executed his commands.</p>

<p>The jesuits ought to pay the king a yearly
subsidy of so much a head for every <i>Indian</i>
through their settlement, according to the
capitation tax. But this, if paid, is sufficiently
returnd by the wages the <i>Indians</i> receive,
when they work for the king, who
at the year’s end is often made debtor to
the <i>Mission</i>. For, in the first place, the jesuits
dont give in the number of half their
families to be taxt. Then the governer of
<i>Buenos Ayres</i>, who ought once in five years
to visit all their <i>Mission</i>, and take an exact
list, is stopt in his journey, and gratifyd for
his trouble: so that he finds it better to
take their own list. And lastly, when 500
<i>Indians</i> are imployd in the king’s service,
the good fathers charge him 1000.</p>

<p>Thus is his <i>Catholic</i> majesty served, not
only in the south <i>Indies</i>, but in all other
parts of <i>America</i>; where his revenues are
half sunk in feignd imployments and imaginary
applications. As for the settlement
of the jesuits, I shall only make this observation
upon it, That all people are more
naturally led than driven; and the same policy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
that founded this government will probably
maintain it, if the fathers keep a succession
out of their own society. If ever
they make a present of this colony to a
foreign power, it must be that of <i>France</i>:
for the <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Portuguese</i> are hated
by all the <i>Americans</i> for their tyranny and
pride: and no other <i>Romish</i> power except
<i>France</i>, would be able to defend and support
its title.</p>

<h2 id="MEMORANDUM"><i>MEMORANDUM.</i></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> circumstance of captain <i>Shelvocke</i>’s
losing the <i>Speedwel</i> at <i>Fernandes</i>, and
his building a bark out of the wreck, has
been received by some people as a most ingenious
wonderful performance: and has
been the chief motive of such as never
heard the like before, to buy the book for
the sake of that story. Therefore I thought
it proper here to mention, two particular facts
of the same kind, tho’ far superior to that of
<i>Shelvocke</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The one is of <i>John Oxenham</i> of <i>Plymouth</i>,
in queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s reign. When Sir <i>Francis
Drake</i> had made himself greatly famous
for his exploits against the <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>America</i>,
the affair at that time being new,
all people were speaking of <i>Drake</i>’s glory
and acquisitions. Mr. <i>Oxenham</i> being a
sprightly man, and emulous of doing something
very extraordinary, set on foot a subscription
at <i>Plymouth</i> to fit out a ship with
seventy men to land at the istmus of <i>Darien</i>;
hide the ship and leave her there till he returnd;
build another vessel and cross the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
land by a river thereabouts, and so get at
once into the <i>South Sea</i> and surprize the
enemy: for he knew that to go by cape
<i>Horne</i> was very hazardous, tedious and chargeable,
especially in those days. This, tho’
it might seem a strange project and like a
wild chimera, yet ’tis certain he performd
it: he left the ship a ground at <i>Darien</i>;
coverd her with trees; went inland to a
river which leads into the south ocean; built
a bark there 45 foot by the keel, and saild
into the <i>South Sea</i>, where he made several
rich prizes. However he afterwards lost
them all with his life by the artifices of a
lady whom he took prisoner. If the reader
is curious, he may find it at length in <i>Hacluit</i>.
Sir <i>Richard Hawkins</i> also has it
in his <i>South Sea</i> journal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other is an example in the reign of
king <i>Charles</i> I. After several experiments
were made to find a northwest passage to
the <i>East-indies</i>, captain <i>James</i> a very skilful
navigator was sent also upon the same
errand: and discoverd more land which he
called new <i>South Wales</i>. He wanderd up
and down those seas in vain; and then winterd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
at a place called by him <i>Charleton</i> island,
in 52 degrees. His ship having all this time
received great damage, he there built a pinnace
out of the said ship; and he with his
people returnd in it to <i>England</i>. See the
journal printed by the king’s command 1633.</p>

<p>If these facts are examined together, besides
many that I could mention done by the
buccaniers, pyrates and others, captain <i>Shelvocke</i>
will appear to have done nothing
at all to boast of: neither can his performance
hardly bear a comparison.</p>
